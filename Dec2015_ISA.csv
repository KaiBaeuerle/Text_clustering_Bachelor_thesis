Hey Chris, Great that we are working together for the competition! Hereby the first proposal for our negotiations.  As for the Catering, I suggest to go for the international buffet. This is because in order to be able to network, the atmosphere should be relaxed and easy-going in my opinion. Having a formal three-course meal makes this impossible. Furthermore, since many people are not familiar with the Russian cuisine, I suggest to go for international food in order for everyone to find food that they like. As for the date of the conference, I suggest week 3. This is because during the first week, the conference colides with the International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow. During the second week, some of ISAï¿½s higher ranked members are unavailable. Week four would be very close to the Christmas holiday and the last week is during christmas, I guess around christmas not many people have time to go to our event. During week 3 there seem to be no problems. The Music Act I suggest is DJ Happy. I really noticed dissatifaction over the last years about the music acts at ISA events. I think to keep people more satisfied a well known international act would be great! DJ Happy is very famous and will attract many people. For the presentation acts it has my preference if I do the speech and you do the awards. Finally, for the sponsor selection I suggest Art Inc. This is because they made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment which we can directly use for the event. Also, they have supported ISA for a long time. I look forward to hearing from you!

Hey Alex, The pleasure is all mine. For starters, I think it is important to acknowledge that the ISA plans to use the event as leverage to assure a successful start for the new office in Saint Petersburg.  This can be assured by establishing contacts to as many local business people and officials as possible. So we should partly adapt to the local culture. In that way, we can show the new members and guests that they are important and make them feel appreciated. Since they are needed for a successful start. Therefore we have to make changes in the catering and/or music act. My proposal is as following: The catering will be a local Russian cuisine. Our Russian contacts will highly appreciate the effort we are making and will experience it as a sort of celebration of their culture. This will enhance our chances regarding reaching business agreements based on mutual consent in the future. I agree with week 3 as the date of conference. DJ Happy is a very famous DJ but he might overshadow the essence of our event. We will have the risk that the act will be seen as the main event and people will be talking about DJ Happy, instead of the ISA. Therefore, I would prefer FreeLife. But, I am willing to book DJ Happy with you, under the condition that I will do the opening speech and you announce the awards. As for the sponsor selection. yes, Art Inc made the highest offer. But Boomerang made a sustainable offer. Also, the Boomerang and Art Inc offer don't differ that much, while Boomerang guarantees a form of financial stability. I think that Dr. Roman Illenschitz will be much more impressed by our business insights by choosing the sustainable offer, instead of simply accepting the highest bid.  Looking forward to your underpinned answer. Kind regards, Chris Catering: local Russian cuisine  Date of Conference: Week 3  Music Act: DJ Happy  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang    
Hey Chris,  Thank you for your response.  I am glad to hear that you agree on the date of the conference.  I accept your compromise on the Music Act (DJ Happy) and Presentation Tasks (you giving the speech). So now the two points we still have to agree on are Catering and Sponsor Selection. As you know, I prefer the International Buffet and Art Inc. I am willing to go with your preference, the local cuisine. However, as a compromise I would then like to go for Art Inc. I look forward to hearing your thoughts! Alex Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.    
Hello Alex, I think we have a solid compromis about to be settled. So I am willing to accept these terms, but I would kindly ask you to elaborate on your choice for Art Inc. over Boomerang. Wouldn't you think that the sustainable financial situation is worth more? Best regards, Chris Catering: local Russian cuisine  Date of Conference: Week 3  Music Act: DJ Happy  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  
Dear Chris, I am glad to hear that you are willing to accept the terms and that we can come to an agreement, I am sure it will be a great event!  Of course I can elaborate  more on my preference for Art Inc. over Boom-erang, I am sorry I did not do so before. Art Inc. made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event. You are right, Boom-erang also made a very good offer! However, they offered slightly less money for the event. I know that they did say that they would be willing to sign a long-term contract in which they will ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. I understand that this gives some security and seems attractive. However, in my opinion, the good relationship with Art Inc. should be considered since they have supported the ISA for a long time. I am therefore sure that their support will continue in the future as well. Unless they are unhappy about something, making them change their mind. Selecting Boom-erang, which is a direct competitor of Art Inc, could be a reason to dissatisfy Art Inc, possibly making them no longer support ISA in the future. For this reason I think we should go for Art Inc, assuming their support in the future and considering the good relationship and high amount of money we will get for the event. I look forward to hearing your thought on this :)   Alex
"Dear Alex, Thanks for elaborating. Let's pop the champaign, because we have a deal. ;) Best regards and pleasure doing business, Chris"
"Great! Hereby my official confirmation of the deal! Champaign indeed sounds like the perfect way to celebrate ;) "
Dear Chris, Hopefully you are doing well. There are still a few issues that we need to discuss in relation to the 40th anniversary event of ISA and our opening of the new department in Saint Petersburg. First of all, for the catering, I really want to propose an international buffet. This allows people to walk around freely and meet all kinds of different people and lets them expand their network. Additionally, this internatonal buffet should cover all the different tastes, offering something for everything. We should also try and organise the event during the first week of December. I think this planning allows as many people as possible to attend the event as it does not clash with other activities. If we would organise it in november this will likely clash with the International Conference on Economic and Business Management in Moscow or the other activities of the ISA staff members, which in my opinion is not desirable. For the music act, I think we should try and get a currently internationally famous act as DJ Happy which capitalises on the international ambiance of the ISA. This will let the event also emphasize this ambiance to the interested parties in Russia. Based on my experience with previous smaller events, I would also love to hold the speech during the presentation. I feel confident enough to speak for groups and I really think I could take care of a good presentation during the event. Sharing tasks is in my opinion not beneficial because we are not able to meet in person and therefore cooperation is more difficult. Lastly, I also think we should choose Art Inc. as our main sponsor as a result of their constant support. Additionally, we can also be sure of them to directly pay their share while we will still need to experience this for the other sponsors. I do not think it is good for our main sponsorship to be uncertain and I think the other sponsors could use this event to proof their trustworthiness for future collaborations. In sum, I proposed the following solutions to the issues: Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris Music Act: DJ Happy  Date of Conference: Week 3  Catering: International buffet   Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Thanks a lot for your message! I am doing well thank you and how are you? Indeed, lets discusses the issues regarding the the event of ISA. 1. For the catering, you prefer an international buffet. During the event there will be many important people there who expect a certain level of formality. For me, buffet is therefore too simple. The succes of the ISA has always been partly due to the successful adoption of local culture. Therefore I would like to propose a local Russian cuisine. I think that this is a vital part of creation good relationship with our future business partners in Russia. It would be very nice if the atmosphere of the event should reflect some local cultural aspects while being a very enjoyable conference for all visitors. Showing them that we are interested in their culture will be in our advantage :) And also for the quests from other culture it is a very nice opportunity to get familiar with the Russian food and music.  2. Music, actually for the same reason as explained above, it would be in our advantage to have the Russian local cultural aspects for the Russian business partners. The strategy of the event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with local companies and officials. Therefore, I want to purpose a local Russian band. And we can communicatie beforehand with them so they can also play some international music at the end.  3. About the date of conference, I totally do agree with you :) Week 3 is definitely the best option for us.  4. About the presentation tasks, you're right that it is not ideal to share the tasks. Because we are not able to meet, but also in my opinion it would be too chaotic if we share both of the tasks. I do not mind to do the awards, if you promise me to prepare well! :) I will also try to do something creative with the awards.  5. Sponsor: I prefer Boomerang over Art Inc, although I know that Art Inc made the best offer and has always donated some money for different events. But without a written contract regarding the future, Art Inc. can always decide to change their intentions. Boomerang is willing to sign a long-term contract. Looked from a long-term perspective, this is in our advantage. Therefore I prefer Boomerang.  Wish you a good evening! Best, Chris
Dear Chris, Good to hear that you are doing well and thank you for your offer, I am doing well myself as well. It was good to see that we could agree on the points of the date of the conference as well as the presentation task. Of course I will do my best during the speech and will be well prepared. While I want to stress that I feel that these agreements give us a solid base, I do want to further discuss and elaborate on the other three points and see if we can come to a mutual solution on these issues as well. While I can understand your reasoning for the local Russian cuisine, I do think that this is not the ideal solution for this event. First of all, I believe that we have to consider the main goal of the event. In my opinion, the event is organised in order to allow people from the ISA to meet up with the local population, as well as to meet their fellow peers. If we were to organise the local Russian cuisine, I think that the opportunities for people to meet others is too limited. After all, people will be given a designated seating and will remain there for the duration of the dinner. This setting is not the most optimal for our clientelle to meet and greet with others as much as a buffet would allow them to do so. In addition, the formality of the event is also already encapsulated within the presentation that will be given during the event. Lastly, I also think that while only offering the local Russian cuisine will allow our guests to get familiar with the Russian cuisine, not everyone might find something to suit their tastes. Therefore I believe that an international cuisine, which offers something for everyone, would be the safest route to go. On the topic of the music act, I think that you have a point in that we should allow for some Russian cultural influence during the event. Therefore I can find myself in your idea to ask a local Russian band to take care of this during the event, as long as we can ask them to also play a bit of internationally flavoured music. Finally, I am not yet convinced on the topic of our sponsor. I really feel uncertain about immediately choosing Boomerang as our main sponsor while we know so little about them. I do agree that they seem a nice company with which we can do great business in the future, but I do not feel the certainty to have them sponsor our current event. I would love to invite them as one of the smaller sponsors and look at extending our cooperation with them for future events but I do think that we should now remain loyal to Art Inc. as they have so far been a very loyal supporter of our organisation and I do not see them letting us stand in the cold anytime soon. I am looking forward to seeing your reaction to my proposal and I hope we can also get to an agreement on these last few points. Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, I agree with you to a certain extent, but not entirely. You are right that we have to come up with an idea to let the guests talk with each other. But buffer is in my opinion not the perfect solution for this issue, because people take their food and go back to their same place. Buffet sounds still too simple for me, since we have such important guests. Therefore, I would like to propose the following: Lets choose the local Russian cuisine. We can arrange a broad menu (meet-fish-vegan). Russian cuisine has many options :) We can send the guests an email one week before the event with the question what they would like to prefer for dinner. This will cost us maybe more (the broad menu), and therefore I agree with you on the point of the sponsor. Boomerangs contract offer is nice, but still it is not a guarantee for us. And because Art Inc. is offering more, we can use this budget to arrange a nice three course dinner for the event.  And to let the guests meet and talk with each other, after every course we can ask the guests to change their seats (three times). This will create the opportunity to talk with different people during every course of the dinner. What do you think? :) Do we have a deal? :) Best, Chris
Dear Chris, I think we can almost come to an agreement. Reading your arguements for a local cuisine I noticed that your main arguement is the formality of the evening, rather than the cuisine itself. I am willing to let my preference for the international buffet go, but I want to argue that instead of a local cuisine dinner, we opt for the international three course meal. This way we uphold the formality of the event while catering towards every guest. I do agree that we should try to get as many Russian cuisine included with the international three course meal, but at least this way we are sure that everyone will enjoy the dinner as the menu will cover a variety of international dishes including Russian dishes. If you also think that we have a deal, I think we can feel pretty confident that with this set up we have set up quite a good event and I am sure that the ISA staff will be satisfied. In addition I think that our event will surely let both familiar and prospective ISA members get familiarized with our newest location in Saint Petersburg. Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, We are almost there! The formality is not my only argument. The main reason for this yearï¿½s celebration being in Russia is actually for future aspects. The ISA plans to use this event as leverage to assure a successful start for the new office in Saint Petersburg (which can only be assured by establishing contacts to as many local business people and officials as possible). The easiest way to show appreciation of Russian culture is via catering and a carefully picked music act. Politically, this will work in our advantage.  And like mentioned before, for the preferences of our guests, we can arrange a broad menu with a local Russian cuisine. The offer of our sponsor Art Inc. gives us space to realize this. Looking forward to hearing from you soon! Best,   Chris
Dear Chris, I think that the idea of an international three course meal that includes Russian cuisine will show enough appreciation of the local Russian market. That, including the local Russian band should definitely give the event a Russian cultural ambiance that will be appreciated by both current and future members and partners of the International Student Association. Additionally, I think we should also keep in mind that the event also marks the 40th anniversary of the ISA, marking 40th years of international involvement. I really think we should therefore also not lose the main appeal of our international association and also pay careful attention to this aspect. After all, we do also want our members and partners to know what we stand for. If we cater too much to the Russian market now, we will potentially scare away Russian locals later when they find out that we are first and foremost an international association. Therefore I really want to stress that in my opinion we should choose for the international three course meal while adjusting the menu in such a way that both international AND Russians will feel welcome during the event, and a long time after the event itself has taken place. Looking forward to hearing from you again. Best, Alex
Dear Alex, Thanks for your quick reply! I really believe that we can fix this last issue. I agree with you that we also need something international. We can search for a local Russian cuisine and ask them to also prepare some general international recipes. Servers from the local Russian cuisine in traditional Russian clothes, serving local Russian food and some general international food! That would be perfect!  Best, Chris
Dear Chris, Also thanks for your quick reply. I remain with my point in that I do not think it is fruitful for our appearance towards our current and future clients to not have a bit of international influence. After all, I really think we should include some of the international ambiance in our event. We could also let the international three course meal be served in traditional clothing if you really insist on it. Alternatively I think that, alongside the local Russian cuisine, we should change the music act and opt for a more international band such as Freelife which are also perfectly able to play Russian music. We could have them play during the event and ask them to play lots of Russian music which we know that they are able to do. That way we can have a more traditional dinner and give it a more international ambiance that is related to the International Student Association while not totally overdoing it by choosing for a big international act such as DJ Happy. In sum, for me the choice is either the local Russian cuisine, or the local Russian band, but not a combination of both. I think that by making this decision we should really remember what the ISA stands for, and for me that is the various local departments combined with the international ambiance. By combining a more international act with a Russian cuisine, or a more Russian act with a more international cuisine, we are fully able to mirror this ambiance throughout the event. My current proposal thus remains with the international three course meal, while I am open to accept the counteroffer I proposed as well if this is better according to your tastes. Best, Alex
Dear Alex, Thanks again!  FreeLife with some local Russian music is perfectly fine for me! Do we have a deal now? :) Best, Chris
Dear Chris, I am happy to say that we now have a deal! Thanks for the negotiation, it was a real pleasure negotiating with you. Hopefully our event will be as succesful! Best, Alex
Hi Chris, I would hereby like to send you my first offer regarding the ISA. Hope to hear from you soon! Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  
Hi Alex, It's nice hearing from you, and I'm looking forward to the event and planning it together. I'm glad to see your first offer. I do agree on having the conference in the third week. However, because the conference is not only to celebrate the 40th aniversary of ISA, but also to celebrate the newly established subsidiary in Saint Petersburg, I would like to appreciate the Russian Culture. As for the sponsor selection, Boomerang is willing to sign a long term contract, which would be very beneficial for future events of ISA. So, I think that would be a better sponsor. I hope to hear from you soon. Regards, Chris Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hi Chris, Thanks for your quick response! I look forward to organizing this event with you too. I think that we can come up with a great plan together. Great that you agree on organizing the conference in week 3! I understand your argument about appreciating the Russian culture, since the event will be organized there. However, I feel like contracting a local Russian band does not fit the character of the anniversary event. Contracting an international, more professional artist will help us in attracting many guests, who in turn will show interest in the ISA. Many complaints have been made regarding the music act in other years, therefore I feel like we should really get someone good this year. Furthermore, I am afraid that providing solely Russian cuisine is not the best idea... Many guests are not familiar with this type of food. What if they don't like it? I feel like it's better to have some kind of international mixture of food (which also included some Russian food), so our guests have more to choose from. I don't know how you feel about this, but I personally aspire a carreer with the ISA. Therefore, giving the opening speech would be a huge honor for me. You could announce the ISA members awards instead. I think that dividing tasks would not be beneficial for either of use, since it looks fairly unprofessional to suddenly switch speakers in the opening speech. Even though Boomerang offers us less money now, I agree that having a long-term contract may be beneficial in the future. Therefore I am willing to compromise with you on this offer. Hope to hear from you soon, Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
"Hi Alex, It's very nice that you agree on the sponsor selecetion. However, before I send a counteroffer, I first want to clearify my own arguments, so I can give a proper counteroffer, with all our aspects taken into account. As for the catering, I expect that there will be many important people, and they will expect a certain level of formality. In my opinion, a buffet is less formal than a menu. Although an international menu would be better, I still believe the Russian food is not that bad. There will always be people who do not like the food, and are picky. We can establish a proper Russian menu, with only the best and most delicious Russian food, and in that way we will appreciate the Russian culture more than with an international menu or buffet. If we would take DJ happy as music act, I'm afraid that his reputation (which is indeed professional and really good), will overshadow the reputation of the ISA. While this event is ment for the ISA, I'm afraid that the ISA will be a ""side-act"" of DJ happy instead of gaining the main attention.  Besides this, I believe the event must be focused on establishing a good relationship with the (local) companies and officials, as we just established the subsidiary with Sint Petersburg. As the establishment of an office in Moscow in 2004 failed, I believe the focus of this event should also be on the Russian culture. For these reasons, a music act focused on the younger generation will be less suited and the Russian cuisine will be best suited for this event. I do agree partly agree on the presentation task. It is indeed unproffesional to devide the tasks. I do agree that either one of us should do the opening speech and the other should announce the ISA member awards. However, as you might understand, giving the opening speech would also benefit my prospect of a possible career within the ISA, as I'm about to finish my studies soon, and already put much effort in voluntary work for the ISA. However, I would consider a compromise on this issue. I hope you understand my arguments, and I'm looking forward for your arguments on these issues. Regards, Chris"
Hi Chris, Thanks for sharing your arguments with me. It's nice to be able to discuss these unresolved issues with you. Another reason why I propose having an international buffet, is because this facilitates networking a lot. Let's be honest: the most important thing on this day, is that people can network. Having a dinner where everyone sits down with the same people for a few hours completely goes against this idea. During a buffet, people would be able to walk around and converse with others. This would be much more relaxed, especially for students who are not used to networking and would like to establish some new connections in the business world. I still think that DJ Happy would be the best music act for our conference, as Russian cuisine in combination with a Russian music act simply does not fit the international character of this event. Regarding the other issues, I already compromised you on the sponsor selection and hope you can meet me on another issue as well. So far, I am not convinced that your options would be best. I hope you take my arguments into account and I look forward to receiving your counteroffer. Kind regards, Alex
Hi Alex, Thank you for your arguments. I do understand that this event has an international character. However, it is not only the celebration of the ISA. The new established office in Sint Petersburg is important as well. If we only focus on the international character, Sint Petersburg might fail, just like what happened with Moscow. I think it is important to have an event with high prestige, since it is not only an internal or local ISA event, but the 40th anniversary. For that reason, a simple buffet is not suited for an event this big. By having a Russian cuisine, we will also appreciate our Russian members and quest. Besides this, the ISA plans to use this event as leverage to assure a successful start of the new office. I believe having a formal dinner would reach this goal better than a buffet. Iï¿½m willing to have DJ Happy as the music act, so the international character, as you mentioned, is not neglected and still part of the event. AS you already compromised on the sponsor selection, I will compromise on the presentation task. I hope you understand my counteroffer. I hope to hear from you soon. Kind regards,   Chris
Hi Chris, Thank you for your counteroffer and thanks for cooperating with me. I appreciate your compromise and therefore am willing to further discuss our catering issue. A third option that has come to my mind is having a tree course meal instead of either the buffer or the full Russian cuisine. Offering guests a three course meal ensures that they can pick the food they like and simultaneously has a more formal character, as you proposed. If we include Russian dishes in the menu, we can keep all guests happy.  Look forward to hearing from you, Alex Catering: International three course meal   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hi Alex, It's nice to see your counteroffer. Indeed an international three course meal, seems better suited in this way. We should then indeed include Russian dishes in the menu. However, I'm still doubting about the music act. DJ Happy is a international star, but focused on the younger generation. A lot of companies and other important persons will come to this event, so focus on the younger generation will not be a good perspective. If we take the Russian band, it will appreciate the Russian Culture. However, I do get the feeling you really disliek having a Russian band. So, to compromise on this issue. I propose to use FreeLife. I've heard this pop band will be suited to accompany the evening without being the main act. 3thereby it will probably satisfy most quest, instead of only the younger generation. With the pop ban FreeLifer, the ISA will still get the main attention. I hope to hear from you soon! Kind regards, Chris   Catering: International three course meal   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Dear Chris, Thank you for your reaction. First off, I have to admit that I am a little disappointed that you have changed opinions regarding the music act. I think that FreeLife will attract less guests than DJ Happy would, and that we therefore will have lesser chances of recruiting new ISA members or sponsors, because there are less guests to socialize with. However, I feel like this music act would satisfy the guests present, therefore I think I could go along with it. To compensate with the smaller amount of guests and therefore sponsers, I do propose that we rethink our sponsor selection. Art Inc offers us more money now, which we can use to compensate and can use to afford the three course meal, since this will cost more than a buffet. I am eager to hear your thoughts on this, Alex
Dear Alex, It's nice to hear your counteroffer. Although I agree tht DJ Happy would attract more quest, the event is ment for the ISA. However, if indeed more quest would show up, ISA has more chance to recruit new members and companies. So hiring DJ Happy, would be good in this perspective. However, I do believe the sponsor selection should be Boomerang. Although they offer less, future perspectives are really good with Boomerang. The difference in short-term payment is slighty less. So I do not believe this would cause any problems, regarding the finance of this event. If we take DJ happy, I would appreciate it if I can do the opening speech. I'm curious what you think of my counteroffer. Kind regards, Chris Catering: International three course meal   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hi Chris, Well, we agreed that I would do the opening speech if we chose Boomerang as a sponsor. Furthermore, we opted for the three course meal instead of the buffet I initially proposed. Yes you are right, of course we have a lot of ISA member that are from an ï¿½olderï¿½ generation, but also a lot of young entrepreneurs and students who will be very appreciative of some more modern, international music. Kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Initially I proposed to appreciate the Russian culture. Athough I do understand now, that perhaps a Russian band would not suit the event best, I also give in on the catering. While the Russian culture is very important in my opinion, I give in the most. As sponsor I still believe Boomerang is the best choice, due to future benefits. As already mentioned, appreciating the Russian culture was my most important issue. I give in a lot on this by not having a Russian cuisine and having your favorite music acts. It seems fair to me, that a small compromise of giving the speech would be suited in this situation. Besides this, if we want to win this competition and thus plan the event for real, I do not believe the most important issue is who is giving the opening speech. I think the most important issues are the catering and music act. While I already give in a lot, compromise for the presentation task than seems rather fair. I really hope you understand my opinion and arguments, and I hope to hear from you soon. Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I understand where you're coming from. Your main concern was to focus on the Russian aspect of this event, meaning that you'd like to present the guest with Russian cuisine and have a Russian band play at the event.  I wanted to focus more on the international character of the event by having an international music act play and providing guests with an international buffet. You compromised me on the music act and we compromised one another regarding the catering. However, I also found the sponsor selection an important aspect of our event, since our sponsor will play a main role regarding finance as well as presence at the event. I fully compromised with you on this issue, therefore I believe that you and I both made sacrifices and gave each other the benefit of the doubt. I hope you will consider my arguments one more time. After you let me know your thoughts on this, I will make my last offer. Kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Sorry for my late response. I did not know that the sponsor was important for you, so I apologize for that. I beleive we have a good proposal for the event, I hope we are going to actually plan this event. However I have one additional condition: at least one of the dishes, within the three course meal, should be Russian oriented (as it is not described in the offer itself). I hope you agree on this final offer. Kind regards, Chris Catering: International three course meal   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hi Chris, Thanks for your reply. No worries that it was a bit later, I was busy anyways. I agree that at least one of the meals in the three course meal should be Russian, as that will most definitely be appreciated by our guests. Therefore, I will accept your last offer. I enjoyed cooperating with you and I hope that our event will win the competition! I wish you all the best in your studies and will see you again at the ISA events. Alex
Dear Chris, Nice to virtually meet you. Attached you will find my first offer regarding the organization for the ISA conference. I would like to give some explanations to my choices: Catering: it is an international conference so an international buffet would provide something tasty for everyone. Also, it creates a nice and open atmosphere to chat around which is more preferable then a stiff 3 course meal in a place where you have to stay seated all evening. Date of conference: week 3 is perfect, because after it it's too close to Christmas and the weeks before then the CEO is not available which will of course disadvantage us. Music Act: the same argument for the dinner, it's an international conference so let's go for someone like DJ Happy who is a very famous performer worldwide and is able to make everybody go on the dancefloor to make some moves, the guests will love him! Presentation Tasks: I'm a very good speecher so I would like to take this opportunity to welcome everybody. Of course, we are doing this together so it's interesting for you to give the awards and you can do with this whatever you want of course, so then we can both do a speech and make a marvellous impression on the crowd. Sponsor selection: the best offer is from Art. Inc. because they give us the highest amount of money for the event. Also, we have already a very good relationship with them and by this they will keep supporting us in the future. I think that was it, I hope you think the same way about the conference and I hope we come to an agreement soon. Kind regards, Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  
Dear Alex, Nice to meet you to. Attached you will find my first counteroffer and you will find my explanations below.  Catering: I think it is better to choose for an local Russian cuisine, because then we show some appreciation to our new Russian members and guests.  Date of conference: I'm fine with week 3.  Music Act: Dj Happy is cool, but I'm afraid that his reputation would overshadow the reputation of the ISA. Beside of that, I think that the music art is an easy wat to show ISa's interest in the Russian culture, so my plan is to order a local Russian band. Presentation Task: Actually, I would like to do the welcome speech to, but i'm fine with your distribution for the presentation task. We both have to make some concessions, right?  Sponsor selection: I will choose for Boomerang because they would be willing to sign a long-term contract. We must have the future in mind.  I hope you will understand my opion, and that you can make some concessions to. Kind regards, Chris Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang    
  Hi Chris, Thank you for your reply. We sure have to make concessions. Regarding the catering and music act we have the same issue: therefore let's go for the Russian band to show our appreciation towards the Russians (as is your argument but I definitely see your point), but, let's take the international buffet to welcome all international guests. We are an international student association after all. Moreover, for the sponsor selection I would really suggest to take Art Inc into consideration because they offered the most money for the event which creates a better opportunity for us to make a huge success of this event. Also, we already have a good relationship with them so if we don't choose them now this could harm the relationship with them. Looking for ward to your reply. Regards, Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  
Hi Alex, I'm oke with your idea about the catering and the music Art, but I really want Boomerang as sponser. I know that Art Inc. has always donated some money for different events. However without a written contract regarding the future, Art Inc can always decide to change their intentions. Therefore, I see the option without future perspective as a factor of uncentainty which can only hurt the ISA in the long time. Boomerang guarantees financial security for several upcoming ISA events (long-term contract).  I hope you will accept this offer. Greetings, Chris Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hello Chris, I will accept your offer. Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Regards, Alex
Hi Chris, Here is my first offer. Hope to hear from you soon!   Best regards, Alex Catering: International buffet  (move around and and talk while eating would be relaxed) Date of Conference: Week 3 (because of collission with other conference, absence, Christmas in the other weeks)   Music Act: DJ Happy (a very famous performer, who would be perfect for this event)  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. (best short-term offer and supported ISA for a long time)  
Hi Alex, This is my counteroffer. I don't think DJ Happy is a good idea. We don't want the event to be all about him, which will be the case when we book him. I think a local Russian band would be better. Furthermore I think Boomerang should be our presenting sponsor, since they are willing to sign a long-term contract.  Catering: International three course meal   Date of Conference: Week 4   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Hope to hear from you soon! Kind regards, Chris
Hi Alex, I do really think we have to choose Art Inc. instead of Boomerang as our sponsor, because they pay the most in short-term AND we already had some good cooperation with them in the past. We can probably continue with them as a reliable sponsor, also in the future. As a 'compensation', if you want, we can hold the conference in week 4 (instead of week 3). For the 'cozy atmosphere' and to give visitors the opportunity to have a social chat with each other, I do really think we need to choose for the international BUFFET. We actually want to create this 'social' thingie, also when dining, right? Seems very important to me and possible future clients. Concerning the music act: no one knows local russian bands and I don't think most people like these. Can we take the middle road with this and choose for FreeLife? Hope to have an agreement with you soon, Best regards, Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 4   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  
Hi Alex, I think Freelife will be a nice compramise. However, I don't think the date of the conference is a fair compensation for the sponsor. Im am convinced Boomerang is a better choice. Furthermore, I don't think the buffet is a good idea. A lot of important people are attending, and they probably expect some more formal dinner. I think the local Russion cuisine would suit best, to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. As a compensation, you may choose the date of the conference and do the opening speech. Hope you will think about my proposal. Best regards, Chris Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 5   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
"Hi Chris, Ok, I'm going to compensate with you. The sponsor will be Boomerang if the catering will be the international buffet. Having a very formal three course meal where everybody sits down for several hours with the same people goes completely against my idea. We should really prepare an international buffet, instead of just a ""local meal"". Since many of the guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, it would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. Shall I give in by choosing Boomerang as our sponsor and you give in to take the international buffet (with my explanation above in mind)? About the date: we should actually not even consider doing it the last week. That is around Christmas! It is definitely the worst choice. Better should be week 3 or 4; you can choose yourself which one you prefer. Above are the remaining struggles. Hope to agree with you today about these situations.   Best regards, Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang    "
Hi Alex, I appreciate your effords to collaborate. I have heard from one of my contacts that the team performance is most important this event, in order to get a job offer. Did you by any chance spoke to someone who had some information that can help us to win this competition? Furthermore, I heard you were very succesfull in organizing some smaller events, and I think for a smaller event a buffet would be perfect. But this event is really big, and therefore I think that anything less than a three course meal would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years, which werenï¿½t even some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversary and much smaller, and thus would harm the prestige of the ISA. That is why I think it is important to go for the three course meal. This event should be unforgettable and unsurpassable! And it would be great if we will win the best team performance. So I really hope you will give one last thought about it. I thought another week would suit you better, but for me week 3 is perfect so we should leave it to that date. Also, I have followed some courses at the university which helped me with speeching so if you like, I can help you with the opening speech. I promise you Boomerang is the best choice. Boomerang is willing to sign a long-term contract. In this contract, they will ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. Such contract would provide financial security for several upcoming ISA events and to some extent for the ISA itself, which is perfect!  So, I hope you will consider the three course meal again and then make an agreement today. I am not saying this because I want to have it my way, but because I honestly believe it is the best choice and I want to win with the best team performance. Kind regards, Chris Catering: International three course meal   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang    
"Hi Chris, It's a good thing you are really putting effort in this collaboration; it makes the teamwork so much interesting and reliable! Fantastic to work with you. If I'm correct, we agree on the presentation task (speech by me and awards by you). We also agree on the date of conference (week 3). The music act seems fine to both of us now (Freelife) as is the sponsor selection (Boomerang). However, I'm stuck with the catering. For me, it feels like I gave in on the sponsor selection (because for me, Art Inc. would really be the best option, but now I agreed with your choice of choosing Boomerang). We've chosen the ""middle one"" when considering the music act. It would be a pity when the catering will also be something I have to give in. The 'socializing' aspect of a buffet feels really necessary for me. Please consider this. If you agree on the international buffet, we can accept our deal! If you really think the buffet is no option for you, we have to do something about our offer again. Please note that the deadline is tomorrow, so there will not be much time to negotiate in depth. Hope to hear from you really soon; the end is near! Best regards, Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  "
Hi Alex, For me the three course meal is already the middle road, since I prefer the local Russian cuisine. If you really think a buffet would suit best for the occasion, I will trust you on that. However, to make the distribution more fair, I suggest we switch roles: You do the awards, I do the opening speech. Furthermore, I would like to suggest we add some Russian dishes to the buffet (next to other International dishes), and since it is a buffet people can choose whatever they like but I am sure our Russian guests will appreciate this. Hope to find an agreement with you today! Best whishes, Chris Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Catering: International buffet  
Hi Chris, I agree with you on all things you said in last message. Thank you for trusting me about the catering. Of course, it will be wise to add some Russian dishes to the buffet, so we will do that. The international 'buffet' format seems the best option, compared with some Russian food. You have a good point in that. To make it fair, I will let you do the opening speech and I will do the awards. If you also agree with all this, we can accept our offers. Best regards, Alex
Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Hi Chris, I think it is nice to organize the anniversary event of ISA together. It would be great if we have the best concept. We will have to make some important decisions and choices on a number of issues such as the music act, the catering, the data, the presentations and the main sponsor.  Here is my first offer to you. I am curious how you think about it.  I would like to get a response soon. Best regards, Alex      
Hello Alex, I'm also very eager to work together. We both have some years of experience with ISA. Therefore, I think, we can make the best out of this! Here are my thoughts about the numerous issues: I would like to have a local Russian cuisine as Catering instead of an international buffet, since the conference is in Russia and one of the main reasons of this conference is for future aspects and a better bond between ISA and the local community and businesses. Thatï¿½s why I would prefer a local Russian cuisine. The same accounts for a local Russian band. In this way we show our connection with the community and that ISA can adept perfectly into the Russian culture. Besides that, I think this is a good way to show ISA that OUR plan is the BEST of them all!  Catering: local Russian cuisine   Music Act: Local Russian band   Considering the date of the conference, my thought was exactly the same! Week 3 is the perfect moment for this conference, so we are not colliding with Christmas and other aspects like important members of ISA who canï¿½t be there. I think we have our first little-part arrangement here.  Date of Conference: Week 3   I think it wonï¿½t be very weird to you if I say that I would also like to do the speech and then you can do the awards. I think this will be hard to negotiate about, so I would like to know your argumentation why you would should be the one who does the speech.  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   And last but not least, the sponsor. You say you prefer Art Inc. and I understand that, because they simply give more money. However, I think that Boomerang is a better choice, since they also provide a long-lasting contract for future ISA events, which Art Inc. doesnï¿½t provide. I would like to know your thoughts about this.  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, Thanks for your quick response.  I'm glad we agree on the date. Indeed, week 3 is the best date for the conference, because of other events and Christmas. Date of Conference: Week 3  I am not totally agree about the catering.  Probably many of the guests are unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine. Therefore, I think that it would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. I can't imagine local specialities working for such a multi-cultural event. Of course the future aspects with Rusia is very important, but I think the kind of food is not decisive. It is important that we fulfill the wishes and needs of our guests.  I have the same opinion about the music act.  I think a Russian local band does not fit the character of an international associationï¿½s meeting. DJ Happy regularly fills huge venues with his events and I am sure that his presence will attract many guests, which could then in turn be interested in the ISA. For a possible alternative, what do you think about FreeLife? Maybe, this is the best solution for both of us.   Catering: International buffet   Music Act: DJ Happy Then about the sponsoring. It is indeed important that Boomerang provide a long-lasting contract for future ISA events, but I think the good relationship with Art Inc. should be considered when making the decision. Art Inc. have supported the ISA for a long time and therefore I am sure that their support will continue in the future.  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Lastly, it is fine by me if you do the speech and I will do the announcement of this yearï¿½s award winners. In that case, both of us are able to say something to the public. I will meet you with this. Would you be able to adapt to some other aspects? Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Kind Regards, Alex
Hey Alex, Thanks for your new offer. So week 3 it is!  Date of Conference: Week 3   I still believe that it is important to show the local Russians that ISA has adapted their culture. Therefore, I propose we do the Local Russian cuisine and then we can let DJ Happy come for the mixture. Although I think FreeLife could be better, you suggest DJ Happy can attract many guests. Which is good for our event. I think we have to agree in this in some way, since we both want a complete different thing. Therefore, 1 Russian thing and 1 international thing is the best solution I think.  Catering: local Russian cuisine   Music Act: DJ Happy   Iï¿½m still eager to know why you would like to present the awards or the speech. Since we both know that this could be an important part in the competition. Doing the speech is something much more rewardable than telling about some awards. So I think that the one who can give a good argumentation about this should do the rewards. I would like to know your thoughts. For now, I put this on shared, so we can come to this later. Presentation Tasks: Shared activities   Considering the sponsor. Iï¿½m a kind of person who likes to look forward instead of backwards. So I still think that Boomerang has the best offer for ISA, since it provides ISA with a bright future. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   I like to hear your thoughts.   Kind regards, Chris
Hello Chris, I think it is indeed a good idea to choose for 1 local thing and 1 international thing. We have a nice balance between local and international aspects. However, I think that the dinner is more important than the music act. People have to feel comfortable during the dinner, because they can network with other people at that moment. I think people feel more comfortable when they can eat food that they know. Therefore, in my opinion it is better to choose for a local music act and for a international buffet dinner.  Catering: International buffet   Music Act: Local Russian band   I would like to present the speech, because during the opening speech I have the possibility to address many important aspects of the future development of ISA. This is a good way to give my vision about the organisation in the future. I expect that you have the same reason, haven't you? Tell me if I am wrong. After your argumentation, we will decide who will present the opening speech.  Presentation Tasks: Shared activities   Considering the sponsor selection. I am also that kind of person who likes to look forward instead of backwards. That is precisely the reason why I would choose for Art. Inc. We have a long-term relationship with this organisation and long-term relationships are very efficient. Moreover, they will sponsor more money for our event. There are two main reason to choose for Art. Inc. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   I am curious how you think about this choices:-) Kind Regards, Alex      
Hey Alex, I think it should be a better idea to do it the other way around. Which means an international act and a local buffet. So more people get attracted to the event by DJ Happy (like you said) and then get a touch of the Russian Culture. However, I will meet you in this. Catering: International buffet   Music Act: Local Russian band   I still think that Art. Inc. isnï¿½t the best option. Since Boomerang gives a longer contract which Art. Inc. doesnï¿½t provide. If we decline Boomerang now, we wonï¿½t get a second chance for their long contract.  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   My suggestion is that we take Boomerang and then I will meet you in that we take an international buffet and local Russian band (like you proposed) and that you may do the awards, since I, indeed, have the same reasons to do the speech as you and means that none of us will have a better argumentation.  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   I hope we can get to an agreement now! Looking forward to work with you. Kind regards,   Chris
Hello Chris, Thanks! I think this is a fair and good composition. You prefer the local Russian band and Boomerang and I prefer the international buffet and the speech. Therefore, we both have two preferences.  To summarize, the event will take place in week 3. We will have an international buffet with music from a local Russian band. Boomerang will sponsor our event and I will provide the speech and you will provide the awards.  Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   I am also looking forward to work with you. In my opinion, we have a good concept now! Kind regards, Alex
Hi Chris, How are you doing? Also excited to organize the big event for ISA? I'm looking forward to work with you and hope that we can organize an unforgettable event! 
Hi Alex, Great to hear from you! Of course I am really excited about the conference and I am sure that we can organize an unforgettable event together! Currently, we already agreed on some issues concerning the conference, but as you know we still have to close some gaps together! I am convinced that we need to create strong relationships with our future business partners in Russia (especially in the long-term). They must feel appreciated and satisfied when they are coming to the conference.  I am wondering what your opinions are about this issue. How do you think we can achieve this? From my previous experiences (I often organized conferences like this one) I know that it certainly pays off that we conform to their local culture. If we use this tactic, our partners definitely will feel welcome! I have gathered some ideas about this and we can create a great atmosphere by integrating some aspects, such as the catering and the music act. I suggest that we book a local Russian band and a local Russian cuisine, based on my previous arguments.  Please let me know what you think about my ideas. Kind regards and I hope to hear from you soon! Chris    
Hi Chris,  Nice to hear from you! I think it will be good to discuss a few points regarding the event.  I do agree with you that a relationship is very important for the (new)business partners in Russia. However, I do think we should not forget about all other countries we are cooperating with. Since we are an international organization I think it is great to bring all the different cultures together in one event. By doing this people can speak other languages and learn about other cultures. So, eventhough the event will take place in Russia, I personally think it will be good to create an international environment. What do you think on this subject? Would you like to focus more on the Russian side or keep it international just as ISA stands for?  If I am right I have the feeling that you like to focus more on the Russian ï¿½partï¿½, I do understand your point. Is it maybe not a idea to combine it a little bit? For instance, having an international night were we present every culture by for instance food and music but just focus a little but more in the Russian culture since it is the hosting country.  Just had little question, pretty important one i think. Before we are able to organize the event we should agree on the date of the conference. I personally prefer week 3 but if I am right your preference is week 4?  Looking forward to hear your opinion. Regards, Alex
Hi Alex, Thank you for sharing your thoughts and ideas. I understand your point of creating an international environment and I do agree on combining Russian with international influences. I think it a good idea to create the international environment by choosing for the international three course meal since this provides a more personal and better service to our guests. However, I would like to focus on establishing a good relationship with the local companies and officials. Therefore, I prefer the Local Russian Band as the Music Act. In this way we combine your preference of international catering with some Russian influences, the Music Act! Coming back to your question: you were right that my preference is week 4 but I am also willing to choose your prefered option of week 3 if we agree on choosing Boomering as our sponsor. Boomerang gives us more financial security on the long-term than Art Inc. Then I am also willing to agree on you doing the opening speech! Tell me how you feel about it! I think this is a perfect offer in which both of our preferences are combined :) Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris,   Good to hear from you again, nice to hear how you think about certain issues. In order to organize the event we have to figure out certain issues.   Lets start with the catering, nice to hear to you agree to have an international meal with some extra focus on Russian meals. You proposed having a three course meal. Personally, I really like food a lot so I would love to eat some fancy three course meal. However, I think for the event it will maybe not be the best idea. Eating a three course meals that people have to sit down for a very long time and talking with the same people. Is it not an idea to organize an international buffet where all guests can eat what they want and donï¿½t feel obliged to keep sitting at the table. I think by doing this people get the case to establish a good relationship with the local companies and offices. If you agree with the international buffer, I will take you out for diner after the event, a three course meal in your favourite restaurant.   Regarding the music act I think it should fit a little bit with the atmosphere of that night, a mix of international and Russian people. I propose to do the pop band FreeLife, pretty new band and I think for them it would be a great chance to play at our event. For us the price is also worthful.   About the sponsorselection my preference would be Art Inc. to be honest. But if im am able to do the opening speech in week 3 that I am willing to think about it a little bit.   Looking forward to meet you.   Regards, Alex
Good evening Alex, I agree on some aspects you propose, such as the date of the conference and the presentation task. It is okay for me that you will do the speech instead of me in week 3 if Boomerang is the sponsor. Besides, I see that you really like to have FreeLife as the music act, because according to you this will fit better to the international athmosphere. I am willing to agree to this, but I really prefer the Russian cuisine for dinner. This is really important, since we expect many important people who will expect a level of formality! Therefore, I am convinced that a buffet will be defenitely a decline from the conferences over the last few years and will therefore harm the prestige of ISA.  I hope you understand my point of view and will agree with my offer:) Have a great evening! My best, Chris    
Hi Chris, Lets summarize what we have so far: - Sponsor: Boomerang - I agree - Presentation:opening speech Alex - I agree - Date: week 3 - I agree   The only two things were is still have my doubts are related to the music act and catering. You know my preference for the international  buffet. I do understand your point about the formality and that it is an important occasion. However, I do think that we should not forget that ISA is an association for students. So I am not sure if it really match with the international student environment. Regarding the music act I propose to do DJ happy. It will attrack a lot of newspaper attention and it really fits into the international environment. I think will create a lot of worth of mouth marketing. what do you think?  How about I get to chose the music act and you take care of the catering?  Looking forward to hear from you. See you soon :)
Dear Alex, Thanks for agreeing on the music act, sponsor, and the date of conference. DJ Happy was not my first choice, but since you are willing to take my preference for the catering into account I will agree with your prefered music act. I am glad that we came to an agreement and I am very excited to meet you soon and to organize this event!!   Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, Do you remember that we still have some issues have not been addressed? I agree that successful collaboration with local figures is important, but I think students are our client base which are the main objects of our ISA, we should focus on them as well. It can be imagined if you attract students' attention, they are more likely to join us and then we will have the initiative in hands. Because our business partners will be willing to work with the ISA to get easier access to these talents. That means attracting students is equal to attracting businesses, and we can get our clients and business at the same time. It is worth doing so, right? So, in order to attract students and make the environment consistent with the international concept of this ceremony, I listed my initial design of this group competition in the below. Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  Let me know, what do you think, and we can discuss details if you have any suggestions or questions :)   Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Thank you for your offer. I am very happy with your choice for Date of Conference: Week 3  . I was wondering what your stance is onCatering: local Russian cuisine  . I would really like Russian food to be there, I am willing to completely let you decide Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  . Also, I would love to have Music Act: Local Russian band  . Finally, Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  is important for me, so I would to know your opinion on this. Kind regards Chris
Dear Chris, Thank you for you offer. I am very glad that we reach agreements on presentation tasks and Date of conference. I understand that Sponsor Selection is important for you, actually it is important for me as well, but i would like to show you my sincerity that i agree to have Sponsor Selection: Boomerang . As you can imagine Catering is important for me, I do think this kind of events we should have international foods just in case that some customers may not accustomed to the Russian local food. So I will insist on this pointCatering: International buffet . Besides, I think buffet may facilitate us to have a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere, it is what we want right? As for the Musica Art, is that possible that we find a intermediate value like  Music Act: FreeLife  ? Best wishes, Alex
Dear Alex, Thank you for your reply. I am glad that we can agree on Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  . Your suggestion for a Music Act: FreeLife  is a good settlement I believe. I agree we should have a nice atmosphere in the conference, so I am willing to let the Russian catering go. You would delight me with a Catering: International three course meal  though, as I would like our guests to have a splendid evening. That's what we both want right? I am looking forward to your reply. Sincerely, Chris
Dear Chris, Sorry I am busy with my stuffs, forgetting to check my email notifictions. Thank god, we almost reached a consensus :). I am glad that you partially agreed with my offer in terms of Music Act: FreeLife and international catering. Like you said, we both want our guests to enjoy a splendid evening, that's why I think  Catering: International buffet  is better than three course meals. In this way, our customers are able to walk around among the guests and freely talk to each other instead of sitting in a fixed place and talk to the same person whole night. Besides, this is an international catering so I think our guests can taste all kinds of food, including Russian local food. What do you think? I am looking forward to your reply. Best wishes, Alex
Dear Alex, I am happy to see we've almost completed the assignent as well :) Unfortunately I feel I cannot give in too much on the catering, and therefore hold my ground on Catering: International three course meal  . I hope you can understand this, I just feel like we have to give our guests something extra. I am looking forward to your reply.  Sincerly, Chris  
Okay, I accept your final offer. :) Glad to have such negotiation with you, I did not receive the notifiaction from this system, so I dont know you already reponded my offer~~ . Best wishes, Alex
Dear Chris,   Hereby, I send you my offer. Thank you in advance for your reply.    Alex.   Catering: International buffet Date of Conference: Week 3 Music Act: DJ Happy Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.
Hi Alex, Great to meet you. I'm glad that you messaged me so soon, I'm really up for keeping the communication efficient and effective, hope you are as well. Are you excited for the event?  So, I've looked at your offer and there are some things I really like. First of all, I'm glad we agree on having the event take place in week 3, since it's not too close to Christmas, important ISA members will be present, and no other important events will take place then.  I have some questions, however, which I hope you can answer since I have some different opinions and ideas on those matters! - Why would you like the catering to be a buffet? - Why do you think it would be best to have DJ Happy as the main music act? - Considering the short-term contract Art Inc. would enter, why do you think it would be smarter to choose them, rather than Boomerang who, although the donation would be less big, are willing to sign a long-term contract and therefore build a relationship based on trust with us? As you can probably tell, I have some different ideas regarding the sponsor selection, the music act and the catering. When it comes to the Presentation Task of you speeching and me awarding the prize, you can imagine that we are probably both keen on speeching rather than awarding. But before we get to that, I'd like to discuss the other points with you if that's okay. I will, thus, leave the date of the conference and the presentation task the way you offered, for now and point out my other preferences.  Please let me know what your choices are based on so I can understand them and elaborate a bit more on my offers. I will hereby present you my preferences.  Good to work with you Alex!  Talk soon,  Chris
Dear Chris, First of all, thank you for your reply. I am looking forward to working with you on planning this event. I hope you're as excited as I am. Then I would gladly answer your questions, because I indeed have reasons for the offers I made. For the food, my first choice is a buffet. Having a buffet during which you would be free to move around and talk while eating seems really relaxed to me. Also, the varity in kinds of food is another important factor, because mny of the guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine. Therefore, I think it would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. The choice for music I made is based on the increasing dissatisfaction of the guest with the music acts at the ISA events over the last years. That is why I think that some currently famous international act would be exactly the right thing to attract the kind of dynamic guests the ISA is looking for. DJ Happy is the very first person I immediately thought of. He is a very famous performer, who would be perfect for this event. And to answer your last question: my choice for Art Inc is very clear. In my opinion, the good relationship with Art Inc. should be considered when making the decision. They have supported the ISA for a long time and therefore I am sure that their support will continue in the future. I prefer loyalty above money. These are the reasons that I based my preferences on and eventually my offer.   I would like to hear what you would prefer or advice.   Thank you in advance.

Hey Alex,   Thanks for your reply. Since we only have until tomorrow to decide, I hope you can reply to my offer soon. I'll tell you straightaway that I am willing to compromise, I already indicated this in my previous offer (having you do the Speech and me do the Awards). Kind of surprising to see that you have not changed your offer to me after having seen my preferences.  So here's what I suggest based on your message:  - You mentioned that Art Inc. has been supporting ISA for a long time. I don't think you are well informed on that. Although Art Inc. has donated previously, they have never signed a contract. Boomerang is, although the donation is smaller, promising long-term relationships. So indeed, I prefer loyalty over money. Please reconsider my offer, I believe it is important to ISA to display stable relationships with sponsors, and Boomerang is the party that can offer just that. - I am really against buffets. This is going to be our first time in Russia, and I would rather show a little bit formality considering the culture. I do agree on the international aspect, so I suggest to do an International three-course meal to keep the atmosphere 'light'. I am willing to compromise on: 1. The music. DJ Happy is my least favorite option, but I am okay with selecting him as the Music Act for the event, considering your reasons. 2. The presentation task. Although you get much more prestige for speeching compared to awarding.  You'll get to decide on the DJ and the Presentation Task. The date of the conference is something we agreed on from day 1. I would appreciate it if you return a different offer from the one you proposed twice already now. It would be great if you trust me in the Sponsor Selection and the Catering. If you're not keen on the Russian Cuisine, then I do hope you are willing to meet me in the middle by accepting the International Three Course Meal.  Hope to hear from you soon, Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris,   Thank you for you reply and for compromising on the music and the presentation task. I indeed did not change my offer, since your previous offer did not overwhelm me.  This time, however, to make it short due to the remaining time and straight to the point I offer you the following. Since you compromised, I am willing to compromise as well. Therefore, Boomerang can be the sponsor, since a contract gives us a long term certainty and, at this moment, we need that. Also, I am fine with the international three course meal, if that is your final offer. As long as we don't serve the local Russian cuisine, which you agree upon. As you can see, I indeed trust you on these two issues. Mainly because of your experiences over the years at ISA. Therefore, I think we have a deal! Thank you for you time and participation.     See you soon. Alex

Hi Alex, I am fine with the date of conference. However, we share some differences about the rest, so that needs some negotiating. Hereby I send you my offer. All the best, Chris
Sponsor Selection: Boomerang Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris Music Act: DJ Happy Date of Conference: Week 3 Catering: International buffet Dear Chris,   Thank you for your offer. I also very happy to see that we are agreed on date. However, I have to bring my second offer. This time I will compromise in orde to come to agreement with joint benefit. So, I agree on Sponsor Selection, but I really recomend to have the International buffet, because Russian cusine could be not suiteble for all gest. Rgs., Alex
Catering: International three course meal   Date of Conference: Week 3   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Dear Alex, Thank you for agreeing on the sponsor selection. However, I do not agree on the catering, because I want to have a real meal and not a buffet, because a large number of very important people will be there and they will expect a high level of formality. Maybe we can compromise on this point and choose for the international three course meal instead? This will be suitable for all guests. However, I think it is very, very important to have some Russian aspects at the conference to show appreciation for our Russian guests. Since it will not be the food anymore, I think it is extremely necessary to have the local Russian band for the music act. I hope you will agree with this, since I also made the concession to you about the date of the conference. All the best, Chris
Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Music Act: FreeLife   Date of Conference: Week 3   Catering: International buffet     Dear Chris,       Thank you for your offer. I would like to compromise on Present Task.   However, I really think that the buffet is better idea, because this way guest could choose themselves with whom they will communicate and if they have course meal they do not have this freedom.   The Russia band could be very nice for Russian guest, but we have different nationalities on this event and they are young people, who could have other preferences. I am real think that DJ Happy could satisfy their needs. But if it is very big issuer for you I suggest we go for FreeLife.  I hope you agree on this too. Rgs., Alex   P.S. I would like to let you know that I am not available on Friday. I hope we can finish this negotiation before. This is no strategy. J Rgs. Not from Alex  
Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Dear Alex, Thank you for your response. However, I really do think that we need some Russian influences at the event. We need to use the event to get in touch with Russian companies and win them over for partner network. Therefore I think that having the local Russian band play at the event will be a great way to show our interest in the Russian culture. The strategy of the event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with the Russians. Besides, since DJ Happy is very famous, I think that he his reputation can possibly overshadow the event and therefore distract attention from the event to the music act. In return, I will accept to have an international buffet for the catering. I think you have a good point that with an international buffet, people can communicate with each other. I hope you can agree on my offer. Cheers, Chris. P.S.: Okay, then we will make sure that we will finish this negotiation tomorrow :)!
Dear Chris,   I accept je offer. Thank you for nice negotiation. Rgs., Alex
Hello Chris, Hereby I give you my first offer. As you can see, I really prefer to make the sponsor deal with Art. Inc. But I also would like to have an international buffet among other things. You can see the rest of the offer in the attachment. Hope to hear from you soon. Best, Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  
"Hello Alex,  Thanks for your first offer! I agree that Art. Inc. is interesting for us, but this is the best offer for short-term; just for the event. Boomerang also made a very good offer and they said that they would be willing to sign a long-term contract. In this contract, they would ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. That's why I prefer Boomerang more than Art. Inc. Why do you prefer Art. Inc. so much? Second, you would like to have an international buffet and I think that serving international food is a good idea! However a real menu is more formal than a buffet. And we expect many important people for this event who will expect a certain level of formality. Is it possible to make it an international three course meal?  I prefer other music than DJ Happy. His presence will possibly overshadow the ISA and I think it is important to show ISA's interest in the Russian culture.  As you can see in the attachment, I agree with you about the Date of the Conference (week 3) and you can do the opening speech and I will do the awards at the end.   I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Best regards,  Chris  Catering: International three course meal   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris    "
Hello Chris, Good to hear from you. Nice to see that we have come to an agreement about the date of conference and the presentation tasks. Although I prefer a buffet because it is easier to start networking at the event with a buffet, I might be willing to settle for an international three course meal. But I still strongly prefer the easy-going atmosphere of the buffet. Since Boomerang is a direct competitor of Art Inc. I believe it is not wise to choose this sponsor. We already have some good connections with Art Inc. and they have sponsored us many times before. We could risk losing this long term relationship by going with Boomerang As for the music, I know that there have been a lot of complaints on previous events about the bad music. When choosing for a more internationally popular band this can attract some more visitors who are interesting for ISA. Hope to hear from you soon. Best, Alex Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Catering: International three course meal  
"Hi Alex,  Thanks for your second offer! It is more interesting, but we are not there yet.  I see your point about the buffet, but networking is also easy to do at other moments during the event. And I actually prefer the other option about the Russian cuisine a bit more than the options with the international food. So an international three course meal is, in my opinion, more in the middle of our preferences. We already have an agreement about the date of the conference and the presentation tasks, that's great! But I would like to discuss more about the music act and the sponsor selection, because they are both important to me.  We have to find an agreement on five points. Now, we already have two points (presentation tasks and date of conference) we are both satisfied with. We have one point (international three course meal) that's more in the middle of our preferences and there are two points left (music act and sponsor selection). I suggests that we both pick one (music act OR sponsor selection) option we really like to fill in confirming our preferences. I already did an suggestion in this offer about that; I would like to choose the music act. That would be an local russian band. So, then you are free to select a sponsor that you really want, like Art. Inc. What do you think about my suggestion?  Speak to you soon!  Best,  Chris  Catering: International three course meal   Music Act: Local Russian band   Date of Conference: Week 3   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris      "
Hallo Chris, Thank you for the offer. I really like how you managed to find a nice way in the middle that would work for both of us. Therefore I accept the offer you sent me. Best of luck, Alex
Dear Sir or Madam, the subject of my email is the upcoming ISA event and to let you know that i am your partner. I'm really looking forward to this event and hope you are as eager to win as i am. To get things started we need to discuss different aspects of the conference. I have some suggestions we should talk about: In my opinion the conference should be a laid back event where everybody feels comfortable and has no problems talking to attending people and meet new contacts. Because of this fact we need an Catering: International buffet  to easily get in touch with other people instead of sitting at the same table for most of the time. Another point is booking a music act. As you probably know, ISA stands for International Student Association which means we need to attract young people with this conference and therefore have a popular Artist. What do you think about Music Act: DJ Happy  ? Don't you think he will be the perfect fit for our needs? One of the really important issues is the sponsor selection for me. Because of our longterm relationship and the offered payment for the event Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   would be the ideal sponsor in my eyes. We also need to discuss the date of the conference. In my opinion, Date of Conference: Week 3  is perfect due to the International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow in Week 1 and the absence of the vice president in week 2. I'm pretty sure you will agree with me on this one. Last thing would be the presentation tasks. I know i'm confident enough to do the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  . What do you think about this topic? I look forward to hear from you soon. Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, thank you very much for your kind message. I am looking forward to the event as well and are very eager to win. I have read your suggestions but I don't agree with you on all of it.  In my opinion a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. A  Catering: local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and friends. In regard to the music act I think our main goal is to focus on establishing a good relationship with local companies and officals, that's why I don't think DJ Happy is a bad idea because there is no guarantee that his reputation will overshadow the reputation of ISA. In my opinion we should arange a Music Act: Local Russian band  instead. Another important point is about the sponsor selection. I don't agree with you that Art Inc. is the best sponsor for this event because there is no written contract regarding the future. Therefore I prefer Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  because I want to make sure the financial perspective of ISA is safe for the upcoming years.  I absolutely agree with you on the date of the conference in Date of Conference: Week 3  .  There is one last point I want to discuss with you because I do not agree with you about the presentation tasks. I think I should do the speech and you can hand out the awards Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  . I look forward to hear from you soon. With kind regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, thank you for your kind reply. I'm glad you're thinking the same about the Date of Conference: Week 3  as is do. I think we can already skip this topic without any further discussion. But i'm not happy with your point of view about the catering. In my opinion we should really focus on our international operations and therefore offer a Catering: International buffet  for our guests. I understand your concern about the appreciation, so how about booking the Music Act: Local Russian band  instead of having both, a russian meal and a russian band? I think this would satisfy both sides and show appreciation to all our guests. I like your idea about the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  and suggest we do it like that. My last issue is the sponsor selection. I'm with you about the longterm financial aspect but i really want to stand out with this event and was hoping to get as much financial support as possible. I think there is no other way than getting Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  as a sponsor.   I look forward to hear from you in the near future. With kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Thanks for your reply. I am also glad we agree on the Date of Conference: Week 3 . I am also very satisfied that we came to an agreement about the Music Act: Local Russian band   and the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex .  Your point about the Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  has made me changed my mind. I agree with you that we have no other choice than asking Art Inc. to be our sponsor.  The only thing I still don't agree with you on is the catering. As I told you before in my first proposal I think the focus of the evening should be on the appreciation to our Russian guests. Therefore in my opionion we need to book a Catering: local Russian cuisine .  Considering that we have a deadline for this competition I suggest we come to an agreement tomorrow as soon as possible.  Hope to hear from you soon, With kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, thank you for your latest offer but its not that satisfying for me. What do you think about doing the Catering: International buffet  but get the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  as you suggested in one of your offers. This would be a nice trade off for me and i hope you like the idea too. Please let me know what you think. Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, With this email I would like to let you know that I accept your last offer. I think we have a good chance of winning the competition and found an agreement that satisfies both our wishes.  With kind regards, Chris
Hello Chris, Hereby my first message to you! I hope you're doing well and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement in the next couple of days.  Hope to hear from you soon.  Kind regards, Alex
Hello Alex, Hereby my first offer to you!  I also hope that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement, good collaboration is very important to me. Kind regards, Chris
"Hi Chris,  Thanks for you offer! There are some things I definitely agree on with you, for instance the week 3! Therefore, I'll agree with your division for the presentation tasks to let you do the speech and I'll present the awards.  However, I do have some issues with your sponsor selection and your catering choices. I feel strongly that we should choose Art Inc., since they have made us the best offer and have supported us for a long time; this is a relationship we should upkeep. Also, regarding the cuisine, I feel that Russian cuisine is very interesting, but limited. Since we are working for an International organization, I feel that we have to keep that in mind and make sure that there is food that everyone likes; or atleast has a broader spectrum of choices. When we choose an international buffet, Russian food will be included, but not the only option, so I feel that this is a good comprise, do you agree? Lastly, music wise I feel like Freelife or DJ Happy, since I feel that the local band does not fit the image of an international event.  I'm awaiting your reponse. Kind regards, Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  "
Hi Alex, Nice that we agree on the date of the conference and the division for the presentation tasks! I thought a local Russian band would be a good choice as the music act, but i agree on you with Freelife, since this music will probably be suited to accompany the evening too. However, regarding the cuisine, I don't think an international buffet suits best for the conference. Since there will be many important people who expect a certain level of formality, i think that anything less than a three course meal would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years, which weren't even some special events like this one. I think it would harm the prestige of the ISA, also regarding the marketing purposes. In my opinion, it would be a good compromise to take the International three course meal then. About the sponsor, i see that Art Inc. made us the best offer, but Boomerang also made a very good offer and they are also willing to sign a long-term contract in which they will ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. I think this is a large advantage and that it weighs more because such contract would provide financial security for several upcoming events and to some extent for the ISA itself. Hope to see your reaction soon. Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, I definitely understand what you mean with the catering, however, the atmosphere should be open in my opinion, since these conferences are often used to network and make new acquaintances. So having a formal three course meal with people sitting really downgrades the idea and possibilities of that evening.  Regarding the sponsor, I still feel strongly about Art Inc., even with the offer from Boomerang. Art Inc. has supported us for many, many years and has never given us a date when they would stop supporting us in the form of a contract. So if we were to hire Boomerang, a direct competitor of Art Inc., not only would we lose Art Inc. as a trusted sponsor, but it would also be very rude of us to show that we as an organization choose the best prize offer over loyalty. I can't unfortunatly give in to both your requests, since I feel strongly about both. However, I offer to propose the following. We choose Boomerang over Art Inc. for this single event and try to work out a dual sponsoring contract with both of them for the future. We also choose to stick to an international buffet, to make sure everyone has the possibility to network and also sit down with people to eat, because after all it is still a student organization and networking is extremely important to students for their future. Please let me know what you think and if my compromise for you is acceptable. Kind regards, Alex
Hi Alex, I can agree on you with your idea about the catering, that the atmosphere should be open. So seen the fact that you are willing to choose Boomerang over Art Inc., I will also compromise on the International Buffet. It will be indeed a good idea to try to work out a dual sponsoring contract with both of the sponsors for the future. So hereby I accept your offer. I think we came to a very good compromise and i'm sure the conference will be a success! Thank you for the great cooperation and see you soon! Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, I'm looking forward to working together with you. I'm confident we are going to organise an amazing event for ISA. I hope you feel as confident as I am and that you are looking forward to it too. I hope we can find an agreement to what we both find important. Kind regards, Alex
Hi Alex, Yes, I'm definitely looking forward to organizing the event! I'm sure we will make a good team together. I only got one problem, I can't see your offer? The programm shows that you made an offer, but I cannot see what your ratings are! I will send an offer now (so you also know my preferences), but otherwise you can tell me what you rated in your first offer, or what your preferences are? Then we hopefully can easily agree on an offer. (I pasted my offer beneath this message, maybe it helps if you do this to, so I will definitely see your offer haha) I'm looking forward to hearing from you!

Hi Chris, Glad we are on the same page! Strange that you couldn't see my offer. I will tell you what my preferences are in this message and in the offer that I will make (as you suggested haha!). Catering: International buffet  Date of Conference: Week 3  Music Act: FreeLife  Presentation Tasks: Shared activities  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. I Hope you receive my offer/preferences this time so we can discuss some issues. Kind regards, Alex P.S.: Sorry for the delay    
Hi Alex,  Thanks for adding your offer! I guess we will have our conference in the 3rd week, since we both prefer that week. Besides I'm ok with FreeLife as well. However, since the music act won't be something Russian, I prefer to do the catering with a Local Russian cuisine. I think that we namely have to strenghten our bond with the Russian companies and I think this will be a good way of respecting their culture.  Besides, I'm also ok with shared activities for the presentation tasks! My last point of discussion is about the Sponsor Selection. I know Art Inc has sponsored us more often and their offer is higher, but Boomerang will give us more security (since it will be a long-term contract). besides, I think that Art Inc still will sponsor other events of us, so it won't be that big of a deal for them I guess. I hope to hearing from you soon! Kind regards, Chris Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Shared activities   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang    
Hi Chris, Thank you for your offer! The conference will take place in the third week then. Happy to hear that you agree with me on the music act and the shared activities. I do understand your point regarding the catering. However, since many of the guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine it would be smarter to have some kind of mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. I also do understand your point regarding the sponser selection. I believe that we should maintain the strong bond between the ISA and Art Inc since they work together for a long time. Since there are two more issues to agree on, maybe we could split them up? I will hereby send you my new offer. Hope to hear from you soon :) Kind regards, Alex    
Hi Alex, I agree on your last offer! I think we will make a good team with organizing the event :) Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, There are some unresolved issues about which I want to negotiate with you. First of all, the date for the event has not been set yet. I think it is best to plan the event in week 3. Otherwise, the event will be too close to Christmas. Date of Conference: Week 3   Secondly, the sponsors need to be selected before the event starts. Since the event is on such short notice, I prefer to ask Art Inc., because of their high short-term payment. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   We also need to arrange the catering. Since weï¿½re an international student association, I was thinking that we should have an international buffet. From that international point of view, I also think it would be nice to ask DJ Happy to perform on the event, because of his international notoriety. Catering: International buffet   Music Act: DJ Happy   Last but not least, we also need to open the event during the opening ceremony. I was thinking that it might seem handy to split the tasks, so that we both can prepare well for one part and it doesnï¿½t get messy on stage. Since you are a longer member of the ISA, it would be nice if you hand out the awards to our fellow ISA members, than I will do the opening speech. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Let me know what you think about this offer.  Best,   Alex
Dear Alex,  Thank you for this offer, I have received it properly. However, I want to suggest some changes.  First of all, I agree on the Date of Conference: Week 3  as this is the best moment in my opinion.  As it comes to presentation tasks, I like your suggestion that you take care of the opening speech and that I will handle the awards. This fits us both best in my opinion. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Furthermore, I would like the catering to be the local Russian cuisine. Catering: local Russian cuisine   As the catering is local, I would like to be the music in style of the food, and a local Russian band would be the perfect fit fort this. Music Act: Local Russian band   Last but not least, we should really go with Boomerang as sponsor, as this is the best option possible. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   I hope to hear from you soon.  Great regards,  Chris
Hi Chris, Thanks for your counteroffer. Nice that we could agree on the date of the event and the division of the presentation tasks. Date of Conference: Week 3   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   I am willing to agree with your idea of sponsor selection, since Boomerang could also help us out with future events.  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   However, I do not agree with your idea of catering and the local music act. Given the fact that our student association is international and it is a multi-cultural event, it seems much better to choose a catering and music act that fits these criteria. Since most guests are from different countries, you don't know for sure whether they would like the Russian cuisine. However, if we go for an international buffet, there would also be food of the local Russian cuisine, so people could also try this. If they donï¿½t like the Russian cuisine, there will be plenty of other food left to try.  Catering: International buffet  The same holds for the music act. I donï¿½t think that most guests are familiar with the local Russian band. Therefore, it might attract less guests to the event than if we choose a music act that everyone knows. Moreover, it is important that we have many guests, since they could in turn be interested in ISA. So, I still think DJ Happy is the best choice. Music Act: DJ Happy   Let me know how you think about this. Best,   Alex
Dear Alex,  Thanks for you offer and that we can agree on Date of Conference: Week 3  , Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  and Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   I disagree with your choice for both a DJ and an international buffet. As we are an international student association, we should introduce something typical Russian, as we now have the perfect oppurtunity for this. Therefore I suggest we let them try typical local Russian cuisine for catering. Catering: local Russian cuisine   I am willing to agree that we let DJ Happy be the music act, as students still want to party, even if they possibly did not like the cating in particular. In that way they can party to common songs that the DJ plays and dance the night away. Music Act: DJ Happy   Please let me know what you think of this.  Great regards,  Chris
Hi Chris, Thanks again for your counteroffer. Glad that we could agree on the date, music act, sponsor and presentation tasks. Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   However, I still disagree with your choice to have the local Russian cuisine. You say that we should introduce something typically Russian to the guests, but the local Russian cuisine is also a part of the international buffet. So, in that way the guests are also introduced to something typically Russian. However, if they donï¿½t like the Russian cuisine, they still have many other options left. If we only have the Russian cuisine and they donï¿½t like that, they might complain. Bad food gives a bad representation of our association and we would not want that, right? It may cause a change of mind of the guests who were initially thinking of becoming a member of ISA to not become a member anymore. That would be a pity. Furthermore, I donï¿½t think that the guests would like to party on an empty stomach. Therefore, I still think that we should choose the International buffet. Catering: International buffet   Please consider the arguments above and let me know how you think about this. Best,   Alex
Dear Alex,  We agree on Date of Conference: Week 3  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  and Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   However, I said that we could do one of the two options internationally, so or the music act or the catering. Since you are insisiting on international catering, then let us arrange a International three course meal. This is still international, the starter can still be something local Russian, but two of the three courses can still be with your likes. I would prefer this, because a buffet will be a waste of money. Most students will not eat a lot and we have to arrange a whole buffet, which will be not only a waste of money, but also a waste of food. Catering: International three course meal   On the other hand, we should really do something with the local Russian culture, therefore, since I am willing to conform to the catering point of view, I strongly suggest we book the local Russian band, as they will  be able to let students be introduced to Russian culture. Music Act: Local Russian band   Let me know what you think of this.  Great regards,  Chris
Hi Chris, Thanks for your counteroffer. We already agreed on  Date of Conference: Week 3   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   andSponsor Selection: Boomerang   I am willing to accept the international three course meal with a starter that is typically Russian. In that way we introduce the Russian culture to the event and still have plenty of other food choices left. Catering: International three course meal   On the other hand, we should not turn our international event into a Russian event by also having Russian music. This would not fit the international character of our association. So, I think that, next to the international three course meal with Russian food in it, we should still go for the international music act. Besides, I donï¿½t think that many potential guests know the local Russian band. I am certain that we have a lot more guests when the music act is well-known and the guests will be much more satisfied with famous music. As I said earlier, the guests could be interested in our association and might be willing to become a member. I think it is very important that we attract those potential members to our party and keep them satisfied. I am certain that such a famous DJ will do both.  Please consider the arguments and let me know what you think. Best, Alex  
Dear Alex,  I am glad we can agree on Catering: International three course meal  Date of Conference: Week 3  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  and Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   However, I still do not agree with your choice of music. In my opinion, a DJ will not be the kind of act for this event, as a band would be more suitable. Since you are so against the local Russians, and I am against booking a DJ, let us find the middle way out and book FreeLife as our music act. In this way, you will not get some Russian culture, which you are so against, and I will not get a DJ, which I am so against.  This is my final offer.  Greetings,  Chris. 
Hi Chris, Thanks for your final offer. I am willing to accept it. The band FreeLife could also play well-known songs and I think this will keep the guests satisfied. I also think that this fits the international character more than having a local Russian band.  I am glad that we could agree on all issues. I am certain that it will be a nice event this way! Best, Alex
Dear Chris, Let's win this year's ISA competition by combining and sharing our qualities. I joined ISA in 2009 when I started my studies and gained some experience in planning and organizing some smaller events, which were quite successful.  I'm curious about your qualities and how this might contribute to our success in this competition. Would you share some with me?  To start, I made a first offer based on my experiences, that might be important to succeed in the competition. Kind Regards, Alex 
Dear Alex,  Thank you for your message about the ISA project. I appreciate that you are so motivated and we can combine our qualities. In 2010, I also attended the ISA in the context of a student internship. Since then, I cooperated with business contacts of ISA in order to help organising internships for other students and therefore I have obtained profound knowledge about the business contacts and their interests.  In my opinion, the adoption of the local culture is a strong point of the success of the ISA. I think this is a vital part of creating a good relationship with the future business partners in Russia. Therefore, I think it is a good idea that the atmosphere of the event reflect some local cultural aspects. For instance, a local Russian band and a local Russian Cuisine.  I had some other preferences than your first offer and I like to hear what you think.  Kind Regards,  Chris 
Dear Chris,  Thanks for your response and sharing your expertise with me. Futhermore, it is pleasant to see we already have a compromise on two out of five issues, namely:  Date of Conference: Week 3  and  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris . However, I have significantly different preferences when it comes to catering and music act during the conference. Mainly, serving more international oriented food will benefict to a more multinational attraction of our event. To a lesser extent, in my view the same applies for the music act. I would like to see DJ Happy or FreeLife on our event, what is your preference between these two acts? Provisionally, I will leave  this option open for you. Finally, I'm willing to agree on your Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  as well, but only when I recognize willingness in your shift to a more international oriented catering and music preference.  I'm looking forward to see your view on these two issues.  Kind Regards, Alex  
Dear Alex,  Thanks for your response and explaination on your offer. On your first offer, I have accepted that you organize the opening speech and I present the awards. My preference was actually to do the opening speech and that you present the awards, but I think it's fine if you do the opening speech and I present the awards.  However, I think we need Boomerang as sponsor. They made a very good offer and they also said that they would be willing to sign a long-term contract. They would ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. And this contract would provide financial security for several upcoming ISA events and to some extent for the ISA.  Furthermore, I would appreciate if there is still something that can be organized in the local atmosphere. I think at least one of the two discussion factors needs to relate with the local atmosphere. My preferences goes to both, the catering and the music in local atmosphere, but I understand that we have to make choices. So, I think it is a good idea to organize one of these factors in the international sphere and the other local. I have a stronger preference for a local catering. The local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. A buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes.  I like to hear what you think about these options. Kind regards,  Chirs   
Dear Chris, Thanks for your explanation on your preferences. Because of the approaching deadline (tomorrow, 4pm), I suggest to put everything in their power to finish the negotiation.   Your explanation on Sponsor Selection: Boomerang seems fair to me, so I will accept that. Futhermore, I will go along with  Catering: local Russian cuisine , when DJ Happy may entertain the audience with his music act. Music Act: DJ Happy      To remember, we now have an agreement on 4 out of 5 issues. I assume, we have a decent chance on finishing this negotiation successfully.  Kind Regards, Alex  
Dear Alex,  Thanks for your quick response. I think we have reached a good agreement.  To summarize we have the local Russian Cuisine, the date of the conference is in week 3, the music act will be represented by DJ Happy, you will present the opening speech and I will present the awards and Boomerang will represent as sponsor.  Thank you.  Kind regards,  Chris   
Hi Chris, Here are my thoughts on some of the issues that still need to be looked at. Catering: International buffet   This seems like the best choice, both with regard to everyone's taste, plus the added benefits of being able to walk around and talk while eating! Date of Conference: Week 3   By having the conference in the third week of the timeframe we avoid overlap with other international conferences and Christmas, and some high ranked members of ISA (including the vice-president) will also be able to attend. Music Act: DJ Happy   DJ Happy will be a welcome change in music in my opinion, especially since there has been an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts art previous ISA events. Presentation Tasks: Third person   I think it will be a wise choice to let an external speaker take care of the speech during the opening ceremony. Having someone important talking about the importance of ISA would definitely be beneficial for the organisation, don't you think? Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.    Art Inc. has been supporting us for several years now, and I think we should honor that by letting them be our main sponsor for the event. That way we receive a nice sum of money while securing their support in the future.   I hope to hear from you soon! Alex PS: Tomorrow (December 8th), I will be out of town the whole day and unable to check my messages. You will hear from me again this Wednesday! :)
Hi Alex,  Thank you for your email and the clear overview you gave of your preferences! I will try to give such a clear overview as well!  Date of Conference: Week 3   To start with, I agree on the third week being the best date for the conference! Catering: local Russian cuisine   However I do not agree on your catering choice. I think it is really important to show our appreciation to the new Russian members and guests. Additionally, I would prefer a real menu, because of the presence of many important people and the related level of formality.  Music Act: Local Russian band   Related to my previous point, I would prefere a local Russian band, to show our interest in the Russian culture. I understand your point of view and I think that DJ Happy would be more attractive for the younger generation, but I think we should focus on establishing good relationships with local companies and officials.  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   I think it would be wise to divide the presentation tasks between the two of us. During the opening ceremony two important persons are already speaking and I think it is inspiring for people to also hear the persons who are behind an event. Thereby, this could also be beneficial for both of our careers.  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Finally, I have another preference on the sponsor selection compared to you. I do agree on that Art Inc. made the best offer in terms of amount of money, since they offer the largest amound of money. However, Boomering is also willing to sing a long-term contract, which would provide financial security for opcuming ISA events. We do not have any written contract with Art Inc. about the future, so they can always decide to change their intentions.  I hope we can come to an agreement about all of these options! Good luck today and I look forward to hear from you tomorrow!  Kinds regards,  Chris   
Hi Chris, I think we're settled on the Date of Conference: Week 3  then! :) Regarding the other points. I agree with your point that the conference needs formality. However, we do need to keep in mind we're organizing this for both students and businesses. That's why I think an  Catering: International three course meal  is a good option. This way we keep it a formal meal, and everyone can still find something they like. To keep the conference still fun for students, I'm still convinced Music Act: DJ Happy would be a good choice. We can't afford any more complaints about the entertainment since the last couple of years. With regard to the sponsor selection, with  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  we still have a good chance of getting financiel security, since they have been our sponsor for so long. Lastly, I'm fine with  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex , so people hear from the organisers as well, like you said. Hope to hear from you soon! Alex    
Hi Alex,  Thank you for your reply! I'm glad we alread agree on two subjects, namely the  Date of Conference: Week 3  and the  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  . I still think the local Russian Cuisine is the best option for the catering. However, since you also agreed to give something up on this aspect, I am also willing to agree on the option of  Catering: International three course meal  .  I still do not agree on the Music Act and the Sponsor Selection. Sure, we have a chance of financial security of Art Inc, but it is not written down on paper, so there always the chance that they will chance plans. I see this option without future perspectives as a factor of uncertainty which can only hurt the ISA in the long run. I want to make sure that also the financial perspective of ISA is safe for the upcoming years. Therefore, I stick to my original offer of Boomerang as the best sponsor.  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  . I do not agree on the Music Act as well. But if you are willing to accept my offer with Boomerang as the Sponsor, I am willing to agree with you on the Music Act. Therefore, I am willing to include DJ Happy in my counteroffer.  Music Act: DJ Happy. I hope to hear from you soon! Kind regards, Chris  
Hi Chris! I think we have a deal :) If you're willing to give in on the music act, then I'll give you the sponsor selection. So the deal will look as follows: Catering: International three course meal   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   So I think that'll be it :) Thanks for your input, I enjoyed negotiating with you!   Regards and the best of luck with your study, ''Alex''
    (no subject)   F   Fabiï¿½nne Vesters   to me 2 hours ago   Details   Dear Chris,       Thank you for having this conversation with me online.   I hope we will have a good collaboration and that we both will be happy with the choices we made.   I want to explain some choices I have made fort he offers.   At first, I think it would be good to have an international buffet, so that everyone has something they would like to eat and that it is possible for everyone to talk with most people as possible.   Secondly, I think week 3 would be a good date for the conference, so that it is not to close to Christmas and that everyone can be there.   Third I would like to do the opening speech and then you can do the awards.   The sponsor selection is very important for me. I really would like Art inc. to sponsor us because they made best offer in term of a short-term payment directly for the event.   Lastly I think it would be good to invite a popular DJ that everybody knows.   Hope you like it and hope to hear from you soon.       With kind regards,   Alex  
"Dear Alex, Nice to hear from you! I also hope that we have a good collaboration and that we are both happy with the result of the annual conference. I think it is important to create a professional and amusing conference so I think we have to come up with something that suits us both. I think you mentioned some good points concerning the conference date. I would rather have it on the second week, but the third week is fine as well. Iï¿½m glad that we agree on that. Iï¿½m not really sure about the international buffet though. Wouldnï¿½t be better to have some local food? I think itï¿½s a good way to welcome our new members and show some appreciation. Also, a real menu is more formal than some kind of buffet. Itï¿½s also good to eat something different and it might be the case that people are more talkative to other people because of the new experiences. Also, I wonder if it is good to have a popular and commercial DJ instead of a local Russian band as it would complement the Russian experience. It would show some real appreciation to the Russians and it ads up to the new (Russian) experience for us. Also, Iï¿½m afraid that DJ Happy would overshadow the reputation of the ISA.. Concerning the sponsor selection. You are right that Art Inc. had a good offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event. However, Boomerang also had a very good offer; they are willing to sign a long-term contract and ensure us with that they would sponsor future events of ISA. So, in my opinion, it is a better option in the long-run and I think we have to look ahead. I think we are safe in terms of our finance when we go for Boomerang. Hence, this is the most important thing for me. There is nothing more important than a good and secure financial perspective for ISA. Lastly, can you tell me why you want to do the opening speech? I also want to do it. But, maybe if you tell me why you want to do it, we can work something out. Hope to hear from you soon too. Kind regards and goodnight,   Chris "
Dear Chris,   Thank you for your quick response. I see we have some disagreements on some things, and therefore I suggest that we both tell each other what we think is most important for us so that the other party can make the decisions on things that are less important for you. The most important thing for me is the sponsor selection, because I think it is really important which company sponsors the event so that we bring in the most money. Art Inc. Defenitely sponsors the most money and they are also able to be our long term sponsor. In this way we raise the most money and we will make sure for a good future for the  company. Next to this, the catering is also really important for me.  The conference should have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances which, in my opinion, requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. Having a very formal three course meal where everybody sits down for several hours with the same people goes completely against that idea. Having a buffet during which you would be free to move around and talk while eating would be much more relaxed. Since many of the guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, I think it would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. So I really would appreciate if you concider this again For me is the date not that much important, so if you really would prefer it to be on week 2, I will agree on that, although I do prefer week 3. You asked me why I would want to do the opening speech. My argument for that is that I have a lot of experiences with presenting and I'm very good at that. Our boss has already gave me some compliments on that. i think it would be good for us both is we do this part very good and show everybody how good we collaborate, but this is not the most important part for me, so if you have other ideas that are better, let me hear. Lastly over the last years, I noticed an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts at the ISA events. Having a local band play at such an event, however, does not fit the character of an international associationï¿½s meeting. Therefore, i am clearly opting for a more international orientation of the music act. You told me you do not like Dj Happy, but maybe we should go in between and consider a les popular act like Freelife?  Let me know what you think of this and what things are very important for you, so that we are sure that are most important things are of our choice.   With kind regards, Alex
"Dear Alex.   Yes, it might be a good idea to say what most important for us individually. But, I see (unfortunately) that we both value the sponsor selection most.   The sponsor selection is also most important for me because of the reasons I mentioned earlier. How do you know that Art Inc. is a suitable long-term sponsor? Boomerang mentioned this explicitly to us so I think that it is, therefore, our best option in terms of financial security for ISA. In return, this could be good for us both.   Secondly, the music selection is also very important for me. I kindly suggest that we use a local Russian band to show some appreciation to our newcomers, but also to create that Russian ambiance. You mentioned the dissatisfaction of the guests, but have they ever heard some Russian local music? This might be just the solution!   I do want to go in between with catering as it is so important for you. Although I prefer the local Russian cuisine the most (for the reasons I mentioned earlier), I think we should have the international three course meal. I think this option is perfectly in the middle as I wanted to have Local Russian cuisine and you wanted to have the international buffet. With this option, you have the international cuisine and I have the three course meal.   Also, I already told you that week 3 was OK so I think we shouldnï¿½t go up and forth with the options we have chosen as it will only take longer to make our decisions and we have to organize the conference soon.   Concerning the presentation task, I really like to present the opening because I already have some good ideas for this to make it interactive and entertaining. You mentioned that you give good presentations. I think Iï¿½m also good at presenting so I think we shouldnï¿½t hire a third person to do the presentation; I think we should both give the presentation.   Looking forward to your response and I really hope that we come to a suitable solution for us both.   Kind regards,   Chris "
Dear Chris,   Thank you for your response. In order to have the best result for us both, I think we need to reconsider some things. I am able to chose the sponsor you want, but for exchange you should also reconsider to chose the catering I want (international buffet). The sponsor selection was my most important option too, so I really helped you with this.  I am also able to give choose your music action, but therefore in trade I want to do the presentation speech and so that you do the awards. This music act of your chose was the last one that I preferred, so this is really in your advantage. I hope you accept this offer, so that we have a deal that is good for both of us and that we both have the things that we think that is the most important for us. With kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Thank you for your response. I think we are sort of in the middle now as we both gave some things (that were important to us) in. Although I would have seen some things differently, Iï¿½m still glad that weï¿½ve selected Boomerang as our sponsor. And, I think we both have the things that were most important to us so that is good. So I agree with your offer.  Thank you for your reconsiderations and letï¿½s organize a nice conference! Have a great weekend and kind regards,   Chris  
Hi Chris! I'm looking forward to working together with you. I'm confident we're going to organise an amazing event for ISA. I hope you feel the same about it. I have some preferences regarding an amount of issues which I will explain in a bit. I hope we can find an agreement to what we both find important.  I'll come to business right away: 1. Catering: I feel like the conference should have an atmosphere to faciliate networking and to find new acquaintances, which I thikn requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. We're a student association, so I think it's less fitting if we have a really formal dinner. Furthermore, a lot of guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, so I think it is smarter to have some kind of a international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. Of course, the Russian cuisine is also a part of that buffet but if some students prefer something else, the option is there. 2. Date of the conference: obviously, it is really important to set the date as soon as possible. We have to take other events and situations into consideration when choosing for a certain date. The fist week collides with the International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow. The second week, some of ISA's higher ranked members (the vice president for example) are unavailable and therefore unable to to join the event. The forth week is really close to Christmas, so maybe not the best option either, same for week five. Therefore, I would suggest choosing for week three. What do you think?  3. Music Act: over the last years, I noticed an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts at the ISA events. Therefore, I think that some currently famous international act would be exactly the right thing to attract the kind of dynamic guests the ISA is looking for. I think DJ Happy is the best candidate to perform at our event. He regularly fills huge venues with his events and I am sure that his presence will attract many geusts, which could then in turn be interested in the ISA.  4. Presentation Tasks: To be clear: we have to make sure someone does the opening ceremony of the event and someone needs to announce the award winners. I would prefer to do the opening ceremony since I really like to do those things and I have experience speeching at similar events. What do you think of announcing the award winners?  5. Sponsor Selection: another important thing to discuss is the sponsor selection. I'm glad we can choose between a certain number of sponsors. Now we can choose one that is the best fit for ISA. In my opinion, it is best to choose for the sponsor which offers the highest amount of money. Art Inc. made the best offers in terms and have supported the ISA for a long time. Therefore, I am sure that their support will continue in the future.  I hope I have informed you enough about my point of view. I'm looking forward to hearing what you think about this matter. Kind regards, Alex
Goodnight Alex! Thank you for your message! I am also looking forward to working together with you. I totaly agree with you that we will organise a fantasic even for IS. Therefore, i will directly show you my ideas, I hope we can combine our ideas to a perfectly fit event.  1. Catering: I am not convinced to do an international buffet. In my opnion it is fitting better to have a formal dinner, since we want to attrack Russian (formal) companies. Firstly, I thought that local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. But I agree with you that there also a lot of other guests from other countries, so I would like to propose an international three course menu. In this case we have a real (international) menu and not some kind of buffet. In my opinion anything less than a three course meal would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years, which werenï¿½t even some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversary and thus would harm the prestige of the ISA. 2. Date of the conference: I agree with you that week 3 is the best option.  3. Music Act: I agree with you that the precence of DJ Happy will attract many guests. But in my opinion this is not the purpose of this event and his presence will also not help to achieve the purpose of this event. In my opinion the strategy of the event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with (local) companies and officials. In addition, the success of the ISA has always been partly due to the successful adoption of local culture. I think that this is a vital part of creating a good relationship with our future business partners in Russia. The atmosphere of the event should thus reflect some local cultural aspects, the music act is an easy way to show ISAï¿½s interest in the Russian culture. Therefore, I would like to suggest an local Russian band. I have some connections in Russia and can arrange a really good band.   4. Presentation Tasks: For me it is fine, You will do the opening and I will do the awards.  5. Sponsor Selection: For the sponsor selection is was doubting between Art Inc. and Boomerang. At the first sight Art Inc. made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event, while Boomerang offered slightly less money for the event. However, Boomerang also said that they would be willing to sign a long-term contract. In this contract, they would ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. Such contract would provide financial security for several upcoming ISA events and to some extent for the ISA itse. In conclusion, both sponsors made a very good offer, in the long term Boomerang will fits the best, but for this event it doesnot matter.  I hope you will see my point of view and you will see the need of including some cultural (local) aspects to show our appreciation of the Russian culture. Kind regards, Maaike
Hi Chris! I'm glad you responded this quickly. I am sure we can come to an agreement.  To summarize: we have agreed on point 2 and 4 and 5. I agree with you on point 1 (to have a three course meal), so we only have to discuss point 3. That shouldn't be too hard! Unfortunately, I don't agree on the Russian band. You're right that it is important to create a good connection with our partners in Russia. However, I think the three course menu is already a formal way of getting to know each other and to show that we are serious about the partnership. In my opinion, the event should also show the international character of ISA. Moreover, it's the perfect way to attract a lot of guests, which is important for the growth of ISA. More members means more sponsors, more money and therefore more impact. I think we should adapt to the character of the international association's meeting since the event is not only to celebrate the partnership but also to attract more members. Therefore, my alternative is the pop band FreeLife.  If we agree on the music, I think we can close the deal! What do you think about my offer? Have a nice evening, Kind regards, Alex  
Goodmorning Alex! Thank you for your offer.  Yes, we have an agreement on point 2 (date of conference), 4 (presentation Tasks) and 5 (sponsor selection).  However, I do not agree with you on point 1 (catering) and point 4 (music act). For me it is really important to include something of the Russian culture, like I said the main goal of this event is to attract the Russian partners. In my opinion the event now only show an international charactater and we do nothing special for the Russians. So I would like to suggest to make a mix between the international character and the Russian culture, since we need both aspects. To conclude, I want the Russian local cuisine (catering) or an local Russian band (music act). The other one can be than international. So in this offer i did DJ Happy as international and catering as local Russian cuisine. Have a nice day, Kind regards, Maaike
Hi Chris! I apologize for misunderstanding you. Now I agree that maybe a mixture between international and Russian is probably the best solution. You agreed with all my other points, so it's fair to have it this way. Do you agree that this is a good final offer? I enjoyed working together with you, thank you for the smooth cooperation!  Have a nice day too, Regards, Alex
Dear Chris, I've been thinking about the event and I have some interesthing thoughts that we should put into motion. the event is allready in a few weeks so we should hurry up. First the Catering: International buffet  is the best because then everyone can eat what he/she wants and there will be no one who doens't like the food, and with the buffet we can create an interactive style where everyone can talk with whom he wants and eat with whom he wants we will create a new and interesting concept for ISA. Second the Date of Conference: Week 3 we should do it in this week because then everyone can be there, if we do it to early there will be a conference where alot of our members will be attending, and if we will do it too late everyone will want to be at home for christmas. Third I think Music Act: DJ Happy will be a great addition for the event because most members sitting here are young and young of mind, if we hire and world famous artist that will good on our resume and we will create more international contacts. The last few years we have had music acts that were for most members so boring that for example, they fell asleep. Fourth the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  i think you should do the awards chris I have seen you present and I think you will be great at it, and also the awards are the most important, therefore I would do the speech I think we will make a fair sepperation if we do it this way. and at last Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. I think art inc. is the best sponsor because they've helped us the last few events to, although it is a short term contract, they have backed us always. Chris, think about it I really think this will be the best options for an succesfull event there in Russia!! With kind regards, Alex (not really ofcourse!)   
Dear Alex, I've read your email and saw your accompanying offer. I'm glad to see that there is at least one thing we can agree on: Date of Conference: Week 3  is fine with me. For me it is not the ideal solution but I'm prepared to accept your offer on this point. The other parts of your offer are less attractive to me. First of all  Music Act: Local Russian band seems like a much better option to me. I think a local Russian Band would ensure a much better connection with the Russian culture. The same goes for the  Catering: local Russian cuisine . I would absolutely prefer a Local Russian cuisine.  Concerning the sponsor selection, I would much rather prefer Sponsor Selection: Boomerang . Concerning the  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  I would rather have it the other way around. But I am willing to do consessions on this part of the offer, if you would be willing to make changes in the music act, catering, and sponsor selection. I already made a consession with the date of conference, so I'm curious if you are willing to make some consessions too. Overall, I think your offer is a great starting point and I'm sure we will reach a suitable solution for the both of us! Looking forward to your counteroffer! Kind regards, Chris 
Hey Chris, Thank you for your fast reply, What is your openion about the  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.I think that Art Inc. is the best choice due to what they have done for us the last few years. I was thinking about the catering what do you think we leave at a  Catering: International buffet then we have all the food varieties from all over the world what do you think about that. what do you think? and then we can topp it off with a Music Act: Local Russian band!  Then we try to select a band or DJ that is great in entertaining parties! Let me know what you think about it! keep in mind we dont have alot of time left. Best regards Alex  
Hey Alex, Great that we can agree on  Date of Conference: Week 3  and  Music Act: Local Russian band  . We are getting there! :) But I would still like to have  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  as our main sponsor, and maybe we can meet in the middle on the catering part by choosing  Catering: International three course meal  ? Remember that now I already made consessions on the date of conference, the presentation tasks and the catering. If you could agree with me on the sponsor selection, and meet me in the middle on catering,  I think we have a deal that gives us both more than 50 percent. At the moment I am only at 47 percent/points.. Looking forward to your response! Kind regards, Chris  
Hey Chris, I want to propose this offer we will leave Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  as the main sponser and then we Catering: International three course meal  as the catering. In the last emails I allready stated my reason why. These terms are my last terms! Do we have a Deal?
Haha ok fine, it's a deal then! To be honest, i was not at 47 percent. This deal comes down to 72 percent for me. Since it doesn't matter anymore because we have a deal, would you mind telling me how many percent it is for you? I am quite curious about it :)   Thanks in advance! Nice to negotiate with you! Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris,  Sorry for the delay! Had to overthink the offer i've made!  I really want to come to an agreement. I think we should give the event an International setting. It is better for the future and the reputation of ISA. Here is my offer:  Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Hope to hear from you soon. If you have any questions, just shoot! Kind regards,  Alex
Hello Alex,  I think this is a good starting offer. Date of Conference: Week 3   The date of conference in week 3 and, Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   the speech by you and the awards by me is fine to me. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Also, the sponsor selection is a great choice by you! However, there are a few things that i do not agree upon. This is my counterfoffer: Catering: local Russian cuisine   I think local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. In any case, I want to have a real menu and not some kind of buffet, since we expect many important people to be there who expect a certain level of formality. Music Act: Local Russian band  I think that the music act is an easy way to show ISAï¿½s interest in the Russian culture and therefore I was hoping to plan on having a local Russian band as the music act. Personally, I have no idea about the Russian music scene but that shouldnï¿½t be a big problem. As long as the local opinion on the band is good and their songs are not too controversial, I only have very few additional requirements for them. I'd like to hear your opinion on the offer. Greetings, Chris
"Hi Chris, Thanks for the counteroffer! It looks good, but I don't think the local Russian cuisine is a good idea. I just want to make sure that the guests get food they like. I canï¿½t imagine local specialities will be working for such a multi-cultural event. You ever tasted Russian food (it's a kind of ""special"")? Catering: International buffet   The local music is ok. I just searched for some Russian music and it sounds good!  Music Act: Local Russian band   I hope to hear from you soon!  Kind regards, Alex"
Hello Alex, Thanks for replying so fast. I have been thinking about your offer, and I think that anything less than a three course meal would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years, which werenï¿½t even some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversary, and thus I think it would harm the prestige of the ISA. I would really dislike having a buffet at the conference. I think having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. Therefore, I agree upon some international dinner. But it has to be a three course meal. Thus, my counteroffer is: Catering: International three course meal     I hope that we can come to an agreement that suits us both, and hope to hear from you soon.  Greetings, Chris
Hi Chris,  Thanks for your counteroffer. The  Catering: International three course meal  is good for me! However, I have been thinking about the music act. I really like the Russian sound, but we have to overthink the choice for the music act. We have to attract dynamic guests for upcoming 40th anniversary. I think a famous international act like DJ Happy would attract many guests. These guests could be interested in the ISA and that's where it is all about. I wonder this would be possible when we pick a local Russian band. It would also be a bit embarrising when the guests don't like the Russian band.  Music Act: DJ Happy   I hope we can come to an agreement! I hope to hear from you soon. Kind regards, Alex  
Hey Alex, I have been thinking about your offer and I don't think this would suit the occasion. In addition, I find the music more important than the food. Therefore, I will accept your offer from 8 december.    Greetings, Jordy 
Hello Chris, I'm glad with the result of our negotiation. See you at the conference!  Greetings, Alex
Dear Chris, How are things going recently? I Hope this message find you well. Since plenty of things for the conference are still pending for us to discuss, I suggest we take more efforts to settle the rest parts as earlier as possible.  Below please find my first offer and let me know what is your preference. Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions. Trust is always the basic priciple for us to work together as a team. Best regards Alex  
Dear Alex, Thanks for your first offer. I think we can agree on the Date of the Conference (week 3) and I think I am willing to meet your proposal for the Presentation Tasks (Speech Alex, Awards Chris).  However, for Catering I believe that a local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guest. For music concerns, I believe it is in our best interests to pick a local Russian band because our strategy of the event should focus on establishing a good relationship with local companies and officials. For our Sponsor Selection I am absolutely convinced that the smaller amount of money spent by sponsor Boomerang is balanced by the offer of a long-term contract which would ensure us some financial security for the future.  Now I am very curious what you think of my offer, and what you would like to change. I think we can work things out.  Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, Thanks for your approval on the Date of Conference: Week 3  and the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  which are settled for now. In my point of view, this event is important not only to appeal to the local business people and officials, but also to attract the atttion of students who are the future talents and tageting market in the ISA. This is why I prefer to make it more international rather than locally restricted. Therefore, I still insist on an international buffet and DJ Happy which will create a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. A free atmosphere would be also good for the local companies and officials to enjoy and let them feel the internationalization of ISA.  As for the sponsor selection, Art Inc is always a good partner for us and they also made the best offer. But if you insist on Boomerang, I can agree with you. Since we need to create more business relationship with other companies, Boomerang is definitely a good option.  Looking forward to hear you soon. Best regards Alex  
Hi Alex, We're almost there. Great we have an agreement on  Date of Conference: Week 3   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  and that you are willing to accept  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang.  However, I still have my doubts about Catering and Music issues. For Catering I understand your International approach. However, I really believe it is nessacary to have some sort of formility in the event, and therefore I think it is important to at least have a coursed meal. Some important guests are coming so it would be a shame if we just offered a simple buffet.  As for music, I believe that DJ Happy would overshadow the reputation of the ISA, and distracting attention from the event towards the his act. So I really prefer a Russian Local band to care for the music. Should you not be able to accept this, than maybe we can ask the band FreeLife to make our event attracting to students and to ensure we don't lose the focus of the event towards the music act.  So hereby I will send you my second offer. I believe we are able to come to an agreement very soon.  Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris I agree with your proposal of asking FreeLife to do the music act. What you said really make sence because we have to care both students and business partners.  But for the catering, I am afraid we have to discuss more. International three-course meal is the worst option in my view. It is too formal and do not acturally fit the atmostphere of our anniversary celeboration. People are table-settled and restricted by the formal dinner etiquette. As a students' international association, ISA should be more energetic and active. So I insist to offer international buffet. To make it more comfortable for the business partners and Russian officials, we can diversity the buffet to make the food and drinks more rich and elaborate. Let me know what do you think of this offer. Since we are almost there, I believe we can figure the last term out soon with understanding and coorpration. Best regards Alex
Dear Alex, I think we can have an agreement on this. I will accept your last offer.  Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, My name is Alex and we are expected to design together an interesting concept for the event of ISA. Hopefully we will have a successful collaboration and end with a good concept. For the event, I would like to focus on the core business of ISA, by creating a new conference concept which puts the students in the focus of this event. Therefore, I would like to propose some changes. Please take this offer in consideration, and I am looking foreward to your response.  Kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Thak you for your email. I hope we can have a nice cooperation on ISA. The success of ISA has always been due to the successful adaption to the local culture. In order to build a good relationship with the our Russian partner, I think the atmosphere of the event should also reflevt on local culture, so I think to choose local Russian cuisine is a better choice for the catering and  for the music act to choose a local band is better.  DJ Happy is too well-known that would overshawdow the reputation of ISA, so it is not so wise to choose this one. And the speech is very important for me because it would have a high impact on my future in ISA. As for the sponsor, I think a long term contract is more guaranteed. Please consider my offer. Thank you.  Kind regards. Chris
Dear Chris, Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your points, but I do not fully agree.  First of all, I don't think DJ Happy would overshadow the reputation of ISA. Over the last years, I noticed an in-creasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts at the ISA events. Therefore, I think that some currently famous international act would be exactly the right thing to attract the kind of dynamic guests the ISA is looking for. In my opinion, the selecting ArtInc as sponsor is very important. Art Inc. made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event. Furthermore, they also said that they would be willing to sign a long-term contract. In this contract, they would ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. Such a contract would provide financial security for several upcoming ISA events and to some extent for the ISA itself. The good relationship with Art Inc. should be considered when making the decision. If the speech is so important for you I am willing to give in. Therefore, I would like to ask you to give in on the sponsor selection and the catering.  Thank you for accepting that the date of the conference is in week 3, one point is solved already! And finally I have a question for you: which two issues are most important to you? Please consider my offer, I am looking foreward to your response.   Kind regards, Alex  
Dear Alex, Thank you for letting me do the speech. For me the most important issues are the sponsor selection and music act. What you said about the Art inc made sense to me, so I would compromise on that. Now we only have two issues need to be solved: the catering and music act. I still think that to adapt to the local culture is the best way to build good relationship with our partners. You said that recently people were not so satisfied with our music act, but we can find a local band which local people have good opinions. As for the catering, there will be many important persons, so it should be formal. I think buffet is more suited to an international event without any marketing purposes.  Our purpose for this event is to open new market in Russia, so Russian food will show our appreciation to our Russian partners. Please consider my suggestions,and if possible could you also tell me what is the most important issue to you?  Kind regards. Chris  
Dear Alex, Thank you for agreeing on the sponsorship. For me the most important points are the sponsor selection and the catering.  About the catering, I understand your point about formality. However, the conference should have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances which, in myopinion, requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere instead of a formal atmosphere. Having a buffet during which you would be free to move around and talk while eating would be much more relaxed. Another important aspect is the choice of the food itself. Since many of the guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, I think it would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. About the music, I understand the local culture is important. However, having a local band play at such an event, does not fit the character of an international associationï¿½s meeting. Therefore, I am opting for a more international orientation of the music act. Nevertheless, I agree with you that DJ Happy is maybe too famous for this event. Therefore, I will do a concession for the music act and go for the popband FreeLife.  Please consider my offer. Kind regards, Alex  
Dear Alex, Thank you for considering my suggestions.   I understand your points about the coference atomosphere should be more international. I think Freelife's music suits the event and satisfiy most of the guests, so I accpet your option for the FreeLife. For the catering and music act I understand your points, I think I agree with you on the choice of food itself. But I think the atmosphere still need to be formal, so I make a comebine of the two: an international three course meal. Hope you could agree with my option. Kind regards. Chris  
Dear Chris, I have have taken your offer into consideration.  Since the music act is very important for you and the cateringfor me, I am offering you the following. I am willing to accept your first choice of music act (the local Russian band) if you accept my first choice of catering (international buffet). In this way we have both our first choices for our most important issues. Do you agree? Kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Thank you for your consideration,and I will accept your suggestion. Have a nice day. Chris
Dear Chris, First of all, I want to say that the best thing to do is to be honest and clear to each other about what we want.  My highest priority is the sponsor selection, I definitely want to have Art Inc as a sponsor because we have a very good relationship with them. They have supported us for a long time and we cannot take another sponsor what might result in losing their support. And after all, they offered us the highest amount of money and they pay it directly for the event. I doubt that there is any discussion about chosing Art Inc as a sponsor.  About the catering. Let's have an international buffet. A formal dinner doesn't suit the atmosphere of the conference, it all needs to be easy-going. When having a buffet everyone can talk easily with each other what is the purpose of the networking principle. Russian is no option I guess, because there is a high chance that people won't know this or won't like it.  Date of the conference: 3rd week. In this week everyone would be present because there are no other conferences as in week 1 and 2 what might encounter the absence of some very important people. (No option!) Furthermore, this data is 2 weeks before Christmas, what would be perfect. Week 5 is during Christmas, so this would result in a very high amount of cancellations (No option either!) Music Act: This needs to be done very well, since the guest were dissatisfied with the acts in the last years. Let's have DJ Happy, he is very famous and good and he would attract many guests. He would fit the atmosphere of the conference perfectly. Local Russian band = boring, what would result in dissatisfaction like the last couple of years.  Finally, let's talk about the presentation tasks. I can imagine that you want to do the speech, like myself. It would look very good on your CV. But since you are longer with the ISA than I am, I think it is fair to let me do the speech. That is the perfect possibility for me to present myself. People don't know me yet and they already know you. This could be very important for my future career. As a thank you for that you offcourse can do the award announcing, what is very important too! You are already very well known within the ISA, and I think that this kind of familiarity is important for announcing the award. Don't you think? Let me know how you think about my offer! Hopefully we can make a good deal for the both of us! Alex Summary:   Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.    
Dear Alex, I am very glad to get the news from you, it is my pleasure to work in a group together, because I heard an information about your achievements on previous work (successful experience in the planning events). Moreover, as we both worked for a long time in that organization (you are on 1 year longer:) I am no doubt that we could make a great performance together. Let me just put some notes and thoughts in our preparation. Sponsor selection: Do you have any statistics about the Art? Could you share with me this information, which division did they support, in which country and so on.... I like them, but I know a little, Boomerang company is more reliable now because they are already willing to sign a long-term contract, which could help us to solve problems about making events in the future. Catering: I agree with you, but on the other hand ï¿½ having a buffet is more suited to an internal ISA and local event without any marketing purpose, in that case I think that local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russia members and guest. About the date of the conference: I was thinking about the first week, regardless of the other event, I think most companies would probably have more than enough employees to send someone to both events... relying on your experience I think you are right, so we can do it on 3d week. Music: Here I'm totally not agree with you, as we will take event in Russia in any case the atmosphere should be close to Russian culture. People would feel more comfortable listening to music usual. Therefore, I am offer you to invite some local Russian band or pop band FreeLife. What do you think about it? Presentation: I am agree with you, but on the other hand, you had a big experience already and I think it would be silly not to mention in your CV that, but what about me I have not anything to write, so what do you think if we change the action? You will awards and I will do the speech...   Just put your ideas, I am open to discuss. I think, the best result could only be achieved by a team work together. p.s. Don't you know is there any information about vocation in ISA, did they post any criteria? Cheers, Chris    
Dear Chris, First of all, I will provide you some information about the possible sponsor Art Inc. as you requested. Art Inc. has supported the ISA for a very long time and moreover they now offer the highest amount of money. We have a very good relationship with Art Inc and if they can support us I'm sure that their support will continue in the future. Boomerang is a competitor of Art Inc, so with selecting them we would lose Art Inc as a sponsor for sure.. What will cost us a lot of money. Art Inc will provide us with way more money than Boomerang, now and in the future. So do we chose for Art Inc? Catering: But do you think that everyone will like Russian food? Most of the people never had that kind of food and if they don't like it, it will ruin everything.. With an international buffet everyone can chose something they like and everyone will be satisfied. We could add some russian food to the buffet to maintain some of the russian influences? Date of the conference: Thank you for agreeing with me. 3rd week it is.  Music: Okay you are right, DJ Happy might not suit the ambiance of the event. But to avoid a disaster like previous years, let's invite FreeLife? Because we know for sure it is a good band and we don't know if the local russian band will perform well.  Presentation Tasks: Allthough I desperately want to do the opening speech, I will give in on this criterium and let you do the opening speech, then will I do the awards. As you proposed.  What do you think of this offer? I gave in on several points, so I think this deal will suit the both of us very well?! Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Cheers, Alex
"Dear Alex, Thanks for provided information about Art Inc. It is really difficult situation, I appreciate our old sponsors, but look on the situation wider. We have to care about our next performances, about the business in future. Boomerang offered just slightly less money, but on the other branch they already want to sign a long-term contract with us, such contract would provide financial security of several upcoming events and to some extend for the ISA itself, is not it a big fortune? In addition, I think Art Inc. would not be upset, because we have many conferences, and finally ISA hopes that this event will attract many new potential business partnersï¿½ Catering: Alex, I just want to mention, that  catering is not a real big deal for the performance, we have more seriously questionsï¿½ But look at previous conferences, anything less than  a three course meal was declined from it over the last few years, and by the way it was not even some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversaryï¿½ I think it could really harm the prestige of the ISA. What do you think?   Music: I heard about them some information; they are not so famous as DJ Happy, but still I think that the strategy of that event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with (local) companies and officials. In that case, I see only a good, popular Russian band for that purpose, and I know some of them. For presentation thanks a lot! You are a generous nature. What do you think about the job in ISA? Have you heard anything about the conditions from Dr. Illenschitz, how will they evaluate candidates? I just want to mention that we have to do our bests in that conference,  weigh all arguments and find the best! Take care, Chris"
Dear Chris, Iï¿½m slightly disappointed about your offer, because I gave in on some aspects and I expected you to do the same to reach an offer that we both think is the best for the ISA.  First of all, you havenï¿½t filled in the catering yet in the offer? I know you want to have a three course meal, but I think that an international buffet will be more suited for this anniversairy, because the atmosphere of this event is more informal than previous events. Moreover, an international buffet is also very luxury and everyone will be satistified about the food because they can chose whatever they want.  About the music act, we really need to think this through. DJ Happy is still my 1st choice because he is very famous and I think the visitors will certainly like him. When a russian band will come we don't know for sure if everyone likes them. This can be a huge fail if we invited them. My 2nd choice is Freelife, because we also know that they are very good and the people will like them.  Sponsor Selection. I am prepared to give in on this aspect. Allthough I really want to have Art Inc. as our sponsor, I'm willing to accept Boomerang as our sponsor.  With this and the previous offer I already gave in on more aspects, so I expect you to carefully consider this offer because I really think is the best for the event. I already will say that I only can give in on the music act, to chose Freelife instead of DJ Happy, but for the rest I really don't think a change will help.  I hope to hear from you soon. Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang    
Hi, Alex! I am sorry for that misunderstanding between us, but look on our arguments, we here to do our best, it is not my willingï¿½I got some facts, and want to share with you: Catering: If you know surely that they would be ok, than letï¿½s do it. However, remember my previous facts, they are not so small not to take them into considerationï¿½I rely on your previous experience and trust you. So let it be your choice. Music: I really donï¿½t see any arguments about them from you, why do you want abroad band? Just remember the 2004 year when ISA was failed in Moscowï¿½. Also I want to mention, that I called to my contact, who is working in ISA. He told me more about the competition and the job selection after it, if we do our best, we will get the job, I do not know about you, but I need it for life and I really know, what I am doing and on what risk I am goingï¿½so let me not to do the mistake, please. Local Russian band is the best choise.   For the sponsor selection ï¿½ thank you, I really appreciate your decision! If everything goes right, we finally would be the full employers of ISA! Best regards, your partner - Chris!
Dear Chris, Thank you for agreeing with me about the catering. I really think this is the best solution since this suits the atmosphere of the event the best! About the music. Let's be clear about my arguments for the choice of DJ Happy or Freelife. Over the last year, I noticed an increasing dissatistfaction of the guest with the music acts at the ISA event. Therefore I think that a currenly famous international act would be exactly right to attract the kind of dynamic guest the ISA is looking for. DJ Happy is the most famous performer. This DJ fills huge venues with his events and I'm sure that his presence will attract many guests, which then in turn be interested in the ISA. Freelife would be an alternative, but they are not comparable to DJ Happy and might not satisfy the guests as good as DJ Happy does. A Russian local band doesn't fit the character of an international association's meeting. Therefore I really think an international orientation of the music act is the best.  I hope to hear your thoughts about this.  Thank you, Alex
Dear Alex, I like that we are closer to make the best event ever been for ISA. About the music I agree with you, but really ï¿½ music is an easy real way to show ISAï¿½s interest in the Russian culture. Moreover, your bands are international level and they would be more attractive for the younger generation. The event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with local companies and officials. It is clearly Russian band suits well....   Cheers, Chris
Dear Chris, I don't fully agree with you about the music, because this event is mainly an international event. But it is true that it is good to include some Russian influences in the event and since Russian food was no good idea I think I have to agree with the local Russian band. Finger's crossed that this works. Thank you for this negotiation.  Alex
Dear Chris, I am very honored to create a conference concept together with you.  Hereby my preferences, I hope you agree on them! Kind regards, Alex Preferences: Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  
Dear Alex, I am very pleased to have a chance to cooperate with you. I am sure, that we will together organize a wonderful anniversary and be successful in the competition. Thank you for Your preferences, overall they represent a good start for this negotiation. Any way, there are some particularities, that I would like to propose. For me, having a traditional anniversary, is one of the most important issues. That is, why I suggest having a traditional Russian cuisine and Russian band as well. So here come my preferences, I hope you find them appropriate. King regards, Chris
Dear Chris, Thank you for sending me your preferences. I understand that the traditional aspect is imporant to you, but since many of the guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, I think it would be smarter to have an international mixture of food where everybody is able to find something they like. The catering is a very important issue to me, because the conference should have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances which, in my opinion, requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. A buffet makes you free to move around and talk with the other visitors, which makes the eating much more relaxed. For me, the sponsor selection is a very important issue. We should take the good relationship with Art Inc. into account for the sponsoring. Art Inc. has supported the ISA for a long time and therefore I am sure that their support will continue for the next years if we choose them. By selecting Boomerang, I think we make them change their mind and they don't want to support the ISA anymore, because Boomerang is a direct competitor of Art Inc.  I hope you find my new preferences appropriate! Kind regards, Alex    
Dear Alex, Thank you for your offer! I appreciate your opinion on these matters an I also understand your poin of view. Anyway, my knowledge on Russian business culture tells me that Russian business men/women really value a proper, formal dinner. That is, why I suggest a local Russian cuisine, because I do not want to insult them by offering too ordinary way of eating, like the buffet is. I am sure, people will have a chance to communicate with eachother - during the dinner or after it. By selectin Boomerang for the sponsor, we are able to sign a long term, secure contract. After this, the financing is in order and we are able to carry out more important issues in our oraganization. Selecting Boomerang we can avoid the risk that Art Inc. does not maybe want to support us long term. I hope you find my opinion and counteroffer reasonable, Alex. King regards, Chris
Dear Chris, Thank you for your offer again! I understand your point of view about the catering, but I really don't think that all people are willing to eat local Russian food at such an important event. I think having Russian food really downgrades the formal atmosphere more than having a buffet. The whole evening is already very formal, and I think that having a chique and decent buffet contributes to a pleasant atmosphere which is comfortable for all visitors. It is important that people are able to network at this event, and I don't see this happening when everyone is fixed to their table for a couple of hours during dinner. If you don't have a connection with the people on the same table as you, you are stuck with them for the rest of the night.  I can go along with you by selecting Boomerang as the main sponsor! I hope that you can agree with my preferences and that you find this counteroffer reasonable. Kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, I think we are really close to finding a pleasant deal for both of us. Thank you for understanding my opinion considering the sponsorship! The traditional Russian cuisine is an important issue for me, as I said before. I could accept the international cuisine, but I really want to maintain the formality in the event by avoiding the buffet. This formality shows our guests that we appreciate them and want to do our best to please them. I am sure, that people have an opportunity to make contacts both during the dinner and after it. So I can accept the International three course meal. I hope you understand my point of view, because formality is one of the basis of the event. King regards, Chris
Dear Chris, Thank you for your response. I understand your point of view, however I am a little disappointed in the way we are negotiating. I feel like I am adjusting more to your preferences than you are adjusting to mine. Therefore, I would like to come with a new offer. I can agree on importance of the formal atmosphere during the night, but then I think that we need a more serious and famous music act. Since no one probably knows the Russian band, I would propose DJ Happy as the music act of the night. I think it is important that all the visitors feel appreciated and taken seriously, what asks for a famous music act. I hope that you are willing to adjust more to my preferences too. I think it is important that we cooperate more in order to make this event more successful.  Kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, I understand how you feel about my last counteroffer. But giving up the Russian cuisine was a really big deal for me. That is why I wanted to get at least some satisfaction about the catering issue. This deal you are offering to me right now, does not satisfy me and I can not accept it. The Local Russian band is a must form me and I was already thinking that we had a deal about it. Anyway, I will give you a counteroffer you already gave me, so it should be fair enough. This is seriously the farest I am willing to go. King regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, Sorry for my late response, I've been sick the last 1,5 day.  Thank you for understanding my point of view. I can absolutely live with this offer! I am willing to accept it this deal, because I think that we can both be satifsfied with it. I am looking forward to organize the event and I think it is going to be a great night! Thank you for the negotiation and the great outcome, Alex
Hi Chris,   As you know we have already settled some issues for the conference together, but there are still some issues left that need to be looked at. I have thought a long time about them and wrote down my preferences. I hope we can come to an understanding and agreement, let me know what you think about them!   Kind regards,     Alex   Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  
Hi Alex, thank you for your massge. I have taken a look at your offer and i can not agree with this offer. The first point, the catering: On my opinion, the best choice is the local Russian cuisine, because we need to attract new companies and people in Russia. So i think the best way to do this is to present local food and music. This leeds me to the second point, the Music Act: It's the same here, i think we should attract the Russians to work with ISA. And on my opinion, the best way to attract them is with local Music. For the Date of Conference, i think i can make a step towards you an agree with your offer: Week 3. For the Point Presentation Task , i want to choose the Speech by me and the awards by you. The sponsor selection: i think the best choice would be Boomerang. they spent a little less money than art inc, but they will sign a long term relationshiop contract and i think i it important to think of future events and future sponsorings. And art inc hasn't signed any long term contract in the past, so we could have a reliable partner for the future with boomerang.   Hope to hear from you soon, Kind regards Chris
Hi Chris, Thank you for looking at my offer and making a counter offer. I have taken into consideration your point about attracting companies from Russia, but as you know, this is an ï¿½INTERNATIONALï¿½ event and we are an International Student Association. Therefore I cannot agree to solely Russian music and Russian food, this would not sit well with all the students, visitors and companies who are not from Russia. An international buffet is therefore the best option. To reduce costs of the music, I would be fine with the pop band FreeLife instead of DJ Happy, but the Russian local music will most definitely annoy the international people at the event. This is not a good idea, since the music last time was not appreciated either. To set another step in your direction, I would be willing to let you do the speech and with me doing the awards. I can also agree on your point made about Boomerang, which sounds like a reasonable idea. I hope you can see my point and appreciate the concessions I made in this counter offer and we can come to an understanding. Kind regards,   Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hi Alex, thank you for your fast reply! I agree with you in the point, that the event is international and not onyl for Russians. But i still think we need to focus on attracting companies from Russia. So at least the catering should be a local Russain cuisine to show appreciation to our new Russain members and guests. For the music act i will take this step towards you, i do not want to annoy all of the international member at this event. So it is okay for me to take FreeLife. I hope you can understand, that we should focus on attracting companies from Russia.  Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, If the Russian food is such a big thing for you, I would be willing to go for that as long as you reconsider letting me do the speech, while you do the the awards and having a proper DJ to make up for the lack of proper international food. This was at least the music will be really good and we can keep both parties, the Russian people and the international people, happy.   Kind regards, Alex Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hi Alex,   If we take the Russain cuisine, it will be okay for me to let you do the speech. But as music act i still think it is not a good idea to take the DJ. I think he will overshadow the event because he is so famous. We should take at least the FreeLife-Band   I hope you will agree with this offer.   Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, If can agree with this, but I would like to come back on another point. Since we are appealing to the Russian people so much and we are attracting Russian businesses, it would not be wise to sign a long term contract with Boomerang. Art inc. made the best short term payment offer, we should take that and get Russian investors for the years to come, like you said earlier. We do this while still keeping the event entertaining and international with the FreeLife music Act. As compensation, I would be willing to let you do the speech while I do the awards. Considering both our points, I think we have the best deal here so far.   Kind regards, Alex Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  
Hi Alex, I really do not think this is a good idea... I really think we have to choose Boomerang because of the long term contract! Therefore i will let you to do the Speech, to take this step towards you. You can see, i do not want to get the best result for my personal interests, but the best result for the event and future events! So i hope we can come to an agreement now.   Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, As you said, the whole idea of the Russian food is to appeal to the Russians and attract Russian business. What good is that if you sign a long term deal with Boomerang if you anticipate on acquiring Russian investors? We might as well have the International Buffet or International three course meal then. If not, then we should stick with Art Inc. It is either appeal to the Russians by keeping the international people satisfied, or appeal to all the international people and choose the same option of Boomerang. One of those tactics is what works best for our future endeavors. And maybe the Russian people like the international food anyway :-)   Kind regards, Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hi Alex, I can see your point here and i think i will accept to not have a local Russain cuisine. But it should be at least a international three course meal, because i think there will be many important people who expect a certain level of formality, also the event is a very special event (40th birthday) and having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. I hope this is a acceptable offe now :) Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, Im not too fond of the idea of a three course meal, I get your idea behind it due to the formal chartacter of the event, but it also requires a lot of coordination. I would be ok with that idea if you help out with the coordination of that and as compensation let me do the speech, while you do the awards. This is my final offer!   Kind regards, Alex
Hi Alex, I accept. Kind regards Chris
Hey Chris, I've selected my preferences to the risen issues. Please let me know what you think about those solutions and what your preferences are. Maybe there are some preferences that we have in common.  Alex
Hi Alex,  nice to meet you! Please see my preferences.  let me know what you like and what you dont. BR Chris  
Hey Chris, Nice to meet you as well! It seems to me that we agree on the date of conference, so I propose we keep that on week 3. We both want to do speech on the presentation tasks, which probably is most favourable for both of us. We can however decide to bring in a third speaker, which is not good for us personally, yet is favourable for the event itself.  The catering issue is actually pretty important to me, so I would like to have an international buffet on that. If that is possible, the music act might be FreeLife to concede some to you. Boomerang is not my most favourable option, yet I think if you agree on my points, I will agree on this issue.  Let me know what you think about this offer. Alex
Hi there,  please below my offer.   BR  
Hi, What do you think about this offer?  BR
do you think it will be a problem for you if we have russian music? 
Yes I'm afraid so. There's nothing for me to gain with Russian music. I think we both are in a win - win situation in my last offer
Let's win then!
Awesome! You still have to accept my offer. Great negotiating with you:)
Hi Alex,  my pleasure :) see you soon!   BR Chris
Hi Chris, I hope you are fine! I am looking forward to working together with you in the competition. I am sure we will make a good team. I have seriously thought about the best way to do this, and i am convinced we need to do it as follows. As for the music act, by far the best option would be to get DJ Happy. He will make the event a fantastic succes. The catering needs to be simple and help to make it a big party. If we organize an international buffet, this is guaranteed. Then the date of the conference. The third week seems to me the best option. I know you are not at ease speeching to a great audience, so I offer to do that myself. Besides, I have quite some experience in this. Bviously, you can do the reward session. finally, I am convinced that Arti inc is the best sponsor we can imagine! So let's go for it. Let me know what you think. don't you agree this would all together yield a great event! Both for you and me as a team! Wrapping up, my proposal is as foillows. Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   All the best! Looking forward hearing from you! Alex    
Hey Alex !!  
Hi Chris, I just received your ideas about the event, thank you for this. However, I do not see any motivation of your preferences. So help me out. This way I do not see any reason to change my preferences. Cheers, Alex
Hi Alex !! First of all I would like to apologise. I didn't see your message on time and didn't know that there is no editing as an option until I submited the offer.Lesson learned.I do realise that we have to work as a team and have to accomodate to each other preferences in order to have successful negotation. I will make a small adjustments and I am looking forward to hearing from you what you think of them.I do agree that the negotiation should take place in week 3. Consider my first offer just as an indicator of my preferences and not as serious one. I do consider that having Boomerang as our sponsor would give us longterm stability so I suggest to have a Boomerang as a sponsor. Considering the catering and presentation task I suggest each one of us should take one.So I can let you hold opening speech but in that case I want local Russian cousine as caterring option or other way around.When it comes to choosing a group I believe that DJHappy will totally outshine the event and I suggest to have local russian band playing or frelife if it is totally unacceptable for you to have a Russian band.We will further discuss these other steps. I am looking forward to hearing from you and your sugesstions.
Hi Chris, Apologies accepted! No worries.  I gave the speech a second thought and want to give you the opportunity of your moment of fame. I would then really like to stick to the international buffet. Don't you know that Russian food is really awful? The students will reproach us no caring well for them. I am willing to accept Freelife for music, since the local Russian band would definitely chase away the students and it would not be good for our international reputation. As for the sponsor, it is clear to me that Art Inc is the best option.  Looking back to this set of options, I am confident that both our needs our well served and that we can have a very fruitful cooperation. Hope to hear from you soon! Best, Alex  
Hey Alex ! Well if you think it is totally unacceptable to have local Russian cousine as catering option then we can have international buffet,but in that case you should let me hold an opening speech.I do consider it is really important to have Boomerang as our main sponsor and in that case I can let you have DJ Happy as music act even though DJ Happy is the worst option from my point of view. I am offering this since I would like to conclude the negotiation as soon as possible since I have a lot of other obligations. So I am doing pretty badly when it comes to my preferences. i can't go bellow this. Thoughts ? greetings, Chris
Hi Chris, I'm so sorry if this offer contains suboptimal elements for you. I regret not having the sponsor I would have liked, but I think this is a good combination, with a succesful even guaranteed! Let's make this final? So, As far as i'm concerned we have a deal. Can you agree and take the last move? Alex
hey  I really cant accept this because accepting this would be equal to failing. You left me with nothing.For me presentation task doesnt mean a lot and I let you get the date, catering and you want sponsor as well.How about this,here is the sponsor but then I am getting to chose music act as final offer.the other proposal is i  would rather switch the roles and you can give me to chose catering,date and music act and i will let you choose presentation task and sponsor. You said in the beginning this is about cooperating and still your words and actions are total oposite.Evaluate what you got, I really dont know what you want anymore,if you are not satisfied then I would gladly accept switching of roles. greetings
Hi Chris, I appreciate your last mail and offer, but I then rather accept this offer which suits me much better. I assume you agree on this. Thanks for the cooperative discussion! Looking forward to working with you. Alex
Dear Chris, In this you will see my first offer! I hope you can see it as a good offer! I am looking forward to see/hear your reaction! Best regards, Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.    
Hello Alex! Your first offer sounds good. I would really like to make a good choice for both of us. So my first offer to you will be that i wil accept your choice with regard to the presentation task and in return i want Boomerang as our sponsor. I think the presentation task is one of the most important one because you wil get a chance to present yourself to the audience. I hope this will be fine to you? Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hello Chris, Your offer sounds really good! Thank you. So i will accept Boomerang as our sponsor. You also agree with the international buffet?  Thank you for your understanding, i appriciate it! Best regards,   Alex Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Music Act: DJ Happy   Date of Conference: Week 3   Catering: International buffet  
Hi Alex, I will also accept the Date Of Conference. I think the Catering should must be a local russion cuisine. There will be a lot of important especially russian businessmen. For the welfare of our Organization it would be a very good choice to have at least a menu. I hope you will share my thoughts. with best regards!
Hi Chris, Very well, but I don't share your thoughts about the local Russian Cuisine. This is because many of the guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian Cuisine, so I think it would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like.  and the conference should have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquantances which, in my opinion, requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere, food where people can choose what they want and like will positively contribute in that.  I hope you will sharemy thoughts, Best regards, Alex Catering: International three course meal   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang      
Hi Alex! Based on your thoughts and answer i think the Catering will be important for you. Honestly i'm not really pleased with the Catering but for a successful conclusion of our cooperation i will accept the international three course meal if you accept a local russian band as the music act. A well choosen russian band who can play different kind of music will not be risky and at least it will show in an easy way ISA's interest in the russian culture. So the conclusion would be that you have selected the date of conference and the presentation task. I have selected the sponsor and music act and we take an compromise with the catering. So i think this will be a fair offer for both of us! with best regards! Chris
Hi Chris,   Your offer sounds good to me, therefore I have accepted your offer. Thank you for your cooperation and iw ish you a good day and a pleasant conference! Best regards, Alex  
Dear Chris, How great that we are doing this together! I'm looking forward to negotiate with you. I looked at the different issues and made my preferences that you can see with this message. I think this will be a succesful negotiation! I look forward to hearing from you! Thanks in advance. Kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Yes, I'm very happy that we're doing this together! By working together I'm sure we can find the best solution possible and be the best team. After analyzing your offer I agree with the date of conference and I'm fine with giving you the chance to do the speech. However, I tink it's very important that the catering would be a local russian cuisine so that we can show our appretiation for the Russian culture. I also think that choosing DJ Happy as the music art is not the best option since his performance can distract people from the main act, that is ISA. In this matter I can comprimise in choosing the pop band FreeLife since I know you don't like the option of having a local russian band and I heard they are suitable for the event. Furthermore, I think choosing Boomerang as the sponsor it's a wiser choice because it's still a very good offer in terms of money and we have the long term contract that can give some security for ISA's next events.  Looking foward to hear from you! Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, Thank you so much for your counter offer. I can find myself in some of the corrections you've made, I think it is okay to change the Music Act to FreeLife. I think that you are right and DJ Happy would distract the main act, ISA. However I think that it would be better to go with the International buffet. The idea of the conference is that people can network and make new acquintances. If everyone has to sit down for their meal, there will be less interaction. Also, many of the guests will be unfamiliar with the Russian Cuisine, if we choose the international buffet everyone will be able to find something they like.   Lastly for the sponsor selection I think we should go for the biggest amount of money and that is what Art Inc is offering. Boomerang offered less money so it would be wise to choose Art Inc. Also, Art Inc has supported ISA for a long time now, so I'm sure that their support will continue in the future. Since Boomerang is a direct competitor of Art Inc I think we would lose the trust of Art inc. I hope you can find yourself in my arguments.  I am looking forward to hearing from your! Kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Thanks for your conter offer. After seeing your arguments I can agree with you in the matter of the sponsor selection because I think you're right that Art Inc. will probably support ISA's next events and its offer is actually better than boomerang. However, I must disagree with the catering. As I said before I think it's very important to show our appreciation for the Russian culture and since we excluded the local russian band I think the local Russian cuisine its the better choice. It' s imperative to show commitment if we want to open an office in Russia. The fact that some guests are not familiar with the Russian Cuisine it's not a problem, it's actually an opportunity to experiment different things and it shows that we are open minded. Also I think doing a sit down meal is more confortable and I don't think it reduces the interaction between the participants.  I hope you'll agree with my arguments and I'm looking foward to hear from you! Best regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, Surely I understand your arguments for the local Russian cuisine and because you wanted to give in at the Sponsor Selection I am okay with your last offer. Let's do this! Looking forward to working with you! Kind regards, Alex
Hi! My name is Alex, and I look forward to organize this event with you. Here is how I'd like to see the event organized. My most important point is the date of the conference. Greetings, Alex  
Hi! My name is Chris. Thank you for your offer. The point  Date of Conference: Week 3  would be OK for me, but the rest needs to be discussed further.   My most important point is  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  . Greetings, Chris.
Hi again! I'm glad that we agree on the date of the conference! But the other points indeed need further discussion. I think it is very important to invite a international guest due to the international character of the event. DJ Happy is a very good entertainer who fills big venues on a regular basis. Also I think it is important that our guest can interact with different people during the event. A international buffet would be perfect for this, people would have to walk and encounter different people. These points are very important to me as well. As a last point I think we should consider Art Inc. as a sponsor for the event, because they put up the most money. Greetings, Alex
Hi! I think that DJ Happy isn't a really good choice. I'm afraid that he gains to much interest and the main goal of the event will be faded into the background. I expect a lot of people coming from Russia. To show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests a local Russian cuisine with a local Russian band would suit best. I would suggest we take a local Russian cuisine and book FreeLife for the music, so both of us should be happy Art Inc. would give us more money than others, but Boomerang is willing to sign a long-term contract that would ensure the sponsoring of future ISA events. This would save us and the ISA a lot of money and work in the future. I would agree to let you hold the opening speech when we take Boomerang as our sponsor for this and future events. Greetings, Chris
Hi! I have another proposal which would please me more. I agree that we have to do something to please the Russian members and guests. So I suggest that we book a Local Russian Band. This band in combination with a International buffet is probably the perfect mix between the Russian and all other members. If we can agree on this mix then I will agree to Boomerang as a sponsor for our event. Greetings, Alex  
Hi! Your offer seems quite fair. The only thing I have to critizice is the buffet. A lot of guests expect a certain level of fomality. A buffet would not provide this. Therefor I really would like to have a real menu. What about the international three course meal? I think this would fit best. We provide the local music for our local guests and the international food mainly for our international guests but also for the local guests to show them that our organization is international oriented. To show appreciation we want only the best for our guests and therfor we offer them a fantastic meal. What do you think about this? Greetings, Chris
Hi! I don't like the formality of the event if we organize it like this. We should also consider the 'S' in ISA that stands for students. In my opinion a more relaxed atmosfere would benefit all parties. If you insist on the three course meal, I have to insist on a more relaxed music act that suits the attending students. Afterall they are the future talents for our organization. A big name like DJ Happy would bring a lot of them to our event. I have to stay strong on this point because we don't want our event to become too formal! Greetings, Alex
Hi! Ok. I see your point of view and i accept it. But rather to change the music I would agree on the international buffet. Greeting, Chris
Hi! This seems like a good deal to me. So I'm glad we could come to a understanding! Greetings, Alex
"Hi Chris! I feel like we're really getting somewhere with the organization of the event. I'm looking forward to it. However, we did not discuss some things yet, so I'm glad we can discuss it this way. So convenient! You can see my preferred choices on the right, but I will explain them further down here.  The event starts with the sponsor selection ofcourse. We should definetely go for our most loyal sponsor over the last years of different ISA events; Art Inc. They made us a great offer and since they sponsored us for quite some time, they will definetely continue doing that if we make this event a success!  Ofcourse, there is no event without food. This event is all about networking and socializing with all international people, so naturally the international buffet is the best choice. I don't know if you tried Russian food before, but it is quite ""specific"", you either hate it or love it. That's why we should definetely go for something international, so there is a great choice for everyone (and it fits an international event perfectly). Since socializing and networking are the main focus, a buffet would be better than a 3-course meal, since you're stuck with the same people and it's very formal. That doesn't suit ISA well, and it would be beneficial for both attendents and business insiders to get to know as many people as possible. And how can we better do that than over a good meal? Than, the date! Week 3 of december would be perfect. We do not have any overlap with other events (such as the International Conference of Economics and Business in week 1, the absence of ISA members in week 2 and Christmas galore in week 4 and 5), so week 3 is the perfect choice. Over the years that I'm active at ISA, I spoke to several members and they told me they do not like the music events on the ISA events. For us, this is actually pretty good news, because we can really make a difference with an amazing act. For me, that's definetely DJ Happy! The guy is extremely famous, which increases the credibility (and awesomeness) of ISA even more and he will attract so many guests that we could recruite for ISA. A win-win situation! Last but not least, the presentation tasks. We should defintely divide the tasks of presentation. I'm suited perfectly to do the opening speech. This gives you time to focus on welcoming the business partners and to socialize with them (I've heard you're amazing at doing that), while I give the opening speech. I've had quite some experience with public speaking, so it would be an easy task for me. After that, you can present the award show!  How do you feel about this? I'm looking forward hearing from you. I'm so exited and really feel we can win this together! Alex    "
Hi Alex, Thank you for your propositions. However i do not agree with some of them. For the Catering, a lot of important people will be present, it is a opportunity to creat long lasting bond with them. A formal dinner is more suitable for those CEO or spokespersons, it will show them that we care. In addition what could be better than local food for the local business owner. I am sur that we can find a chief to cook specialities everyone like. I agree for the week 3. A too famous artist could put the ISA event in the second plan and it is defenitly not the appropriate artist for that kind of event. A local russian band will show that we can adapt to this new country. I am glad that you think i am a good host, but what kind of experience do you have in show hosting? I know you are still a student. I did several months of internship and i am used to talk to businessmen. In addition i think your former proposition describe your taste in party, that is why i think I should host the speech and then you can present the award show which will be suitable for a show man like you. Finally, Boomerang made a proposition with a very good offer and also they would be willing to sign a long-term contract. I would be a pity to miss such a good opportunity. We have to think to the futur of this subsidiary. This competition is a good way for you to gain experience, you have a good background as student party planner but this is a more complex and formal event. I am looking forward hearing from you. Best regards
Hi Chris! Thank you for your propositions as well, you made some good remarks. I think we make such a good team because we have different experiences in different fiels, so I agree that we change the presentation tasks. However, we should not forget that we both have our fields of expertise. Since I'm an active student within ISA, I know exactly what students want for such kind of event, and without enthusiastic students, the event won't be a success. You have a great network in business, so we should definitely use that as well.  Right now, our biggest challenge is to make ISA a success in Russia, since it was a huge flop a few years ago. That's why I strongly recommend to take my advice on the music act. DJ Happy has an international allure, a great image and good music. I know for sure students will love him. He is not controversial in any way, so there is no problem for our business partners either. A Russian band is a truly bad idea in my opinion, since that doesn't give an international allure to the party in any way, and in my eyes ensures a second flop. If we need to choose a band, it should be FreeLife, but I can assure you DJ Happy will attract the most students and even makes headlines in the press, which would be awesome for the exposure of ISA! Furthermore, the sponsor selection. I know Boomerang offers us a great deal, but I am still not sure why you prefer them over Art inc. For me, the advantages of Art Inc. are that they are our long-term, super loyal sponsor and they have the best short-term payment offer. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that they won't sponsor us in the next years if the event will be a success. If we choose their main competitor, Boomerang, we will loose Art Inc. forever, and chances are that Boomerang backs out after 2 years, so we end up with nothing. About the Catering, I get that a lot of important people are present and we have to please them. However, we should not forget that we have to please the students as well. Without students, there is no ISA and those bond with businesses are useless then. From my perspective, we should definitely create an atmosphere where people are easily able to talk with a lot of different people and network their way around. An international buffet for me is still the best way to network for both students and business partners, and since that is the main reason to host this party, we should go for that. We know the international food will be as good as the formal dinner, and this is as good for local businesses since we don't ship the food from all over the place. I'm looking forward hearing from you! Alex
Hi Alex, Thank you for your ideas. Also, you can be sure that i will use 100% of my experience in business relationship to perform the best speech. I agree that in my former offer I did not think enough of the students. You made a point saying that without student there is no ISA. That's why hiring Dj Happy for the event is a good opportunity to make us known and satisfy the students. We both agree that the point is to make ISA a sucess in Russia, thus i think that we should respect their way of life and moreover the respect to the elders, which is a critical point in their respect tradition. I am not sure that having the business owners eating standing in paper plate is a good way to show them our respect and our will to work with them. So a local Russian dinner is much more suitable for the event and local traditions.  Also i think that a buffet before a concert with a famous artist does not show the real importance of this event for us. Finally, the choice of the sponsor. As you said there is a chance that Boomerang back out after 2 years (Where does this figure come from ?), there is also a chance that Art. Inc back out tomorrow without contract ! That is why I recommend that we choose Bommerang to ensure us a regular income for the fragile beginning of ISA in Russia. I am looking forward hearing from you, Alex. Best regards  
Hi Chris, Thank you for your quick response! I will try to keep it a little shorter this time.  I trust you on your expertise on the sponsor selection, so I am willing to concede and go for Boomerang in this case.  However, I still strongly disagree with the food. It is really important for me to go for the international buffet. Besides the fact that it will meet the needs of every guest, we are and will be an international association, with international guests and students. A buffet does not necessarily mean that people need to eat from paper plates while standing, and I'm sure we can make it look very fancy and formal. We can work out the details about this later, but think of fancy plates, exquisite dishes and more! Don't worry, I'm sure this will be perfect for everyone! I hope you are willing to change your catering preferences, as I did with the sponsor selection. Hopefully we'll have an agreement, let's do this! Alex
Hi Alex, I understand your position about the catering but i still disagree. Here is my final offer, I changed my mind and I decided to trust you about the sponsor selection. However i still think that the local Russian food is the best option. If we do not agree on this offer, We will not find an agrement. I hope you are intelligent enough to accept this offer, an other job opportunity in ISA like this one will not show up soon. Best regards
Hi Chris, I'm quite surprised by your sturdy e-mail. I do not like you threathening me with my future ISA career at all. Over the past days, we've had nice, constructive negotiations so I don't know where this attitude is coming from, but I certainly do not appreciate it.  This doesn't change my mind about the catering at all. I want to compromise with going for a three-course international meal, so hopefully you can agree on that. For me, this is also my last offer, and I'm hoping you will agree on it. If not, I'm very sorry about that, but there is nothing we can do about it. If ISA works the way you describe, by giving me no other opportunities because I disagree on something, but propose solutions in a constructive manner, I do not even want to be part of this organization. I like fair play, and playing like this is certainly not fair. Alex
It is a pity. Best Wishes
Hello Chris!  My name is Alex, you will be negotiating with me! I'm looking forward in communicating and negotiating with you!   Greetings,   Christ
Hello Alex, It is a pleasure to hear from you. I am looking forward to do this. Let's make a good impression on the ISA jury with our upcoming event in Mother Russia! It would be great if we were chosen for planning the event. I know this is your first big international event, but with the right proposal i believe we will certainly stand a chance. About the competition part of creating this event: I asked my sources within the ISA how our performance will be evaluated and while some where reluctant to tell me, while others told me that the best shared proposal would make it, which if you think about is quite obvious. The winning partners could also receive jobs within ISA so that's not to be forgotten either! And even if ISA does not give us a job, I am certain organising the event would give us great opportunities with some of the internationally renowned Russian firms. Because of this, I think it would be best if we could make the firms feel at home as much as possible. I heard you are not a personal fan of the Russian quisine and music but i believe this might be the best way to do this. Some of my sources stated that many of the companies are globalised, but their boards still cling to the traditions of the home country. We also really need to set a date for the event asap, any suggestions there? Then there's of course the sponsoring and the opening presentation left. I know the biggest budget is given by the Art Inc., and this would make us able to do everything we want with the event. This would be the most important thing if we want to make the event really big, but with the wishes of ISA in mind we might also consider the offer of Boomerang, who would give the ISA financial stability over the coming years. Getting this deal might appease the ISA board enough to declare us the official event planners! I would like to have your opinion on this matter, since taking the Boomerang deal could bring us in financial trouble if we also want to get a world-renowned speaker for the ceremony. Then again I would like to do the speech ourselves more, because it would be great for our experience and our image to both Russian firms and the jury. I put the Boomerang-shared activities combination in the offer just to be able to have something to send, but we will have to discuss that one further. I hope to hear from you again soon! Greetings, Chris
  Dear Chris,   Yes letï¿½s make this a great event where everyone can be proud of!   With regards to your first point about the Russian cuisine, I think you have a valid point when saying that Russian cuisine fits for a lot of firms. I do however believe that it is better to mix it up a bit since it is an international event where not only Russian people will attend. In my opinion it is best to have a international buffet. This also captures the spirit of the organisation. Finally, I would suggest that DJ happy does the music for this event since he can mix a bit of every style music and make it fun for everyone. So we can maybe request him to also play some Russian music but al,so music that people from other countries like!   For the date I was thinking the first half of December since the second half has numerous holidays. This means that people will not be able to attend. In additions, the first two weeks of December will make it impossible for some executives to attend. So I was thinking the third week would be the best option.    With regards to the sponsoring, I think that Art. Inc would be the best option for short term for us right now and this is preferable for the event. In addition, Boomerang does offer a long term contract but we cannot predict the future so I think we should choose for Art Inc. that will make this event splendid and if all goes well we can consider further collaboration with them. Boomerang is a second good option.   The speech would be nice if we did it ourselves since this would put us in a spotlight. I was however thinking of how to divide the tasks regarding this matter. What are your thoughts?   Greetings!     Alex
Dear Alex, Nice to hear that you're as enthusiastic as i am! I have read your proposals thoroughly. You have made some fair points in them. I would like to discuss some of them a bit more elaborately.  About the date, I left it on the 3th week, but I was wondering why you think the 3th is better than the 4th. I also know why you think the 2nd is bad, but i believe that it would leave our event attendance a bit vulnerable if there was exactly one week between our event and the big event of the first week. A lot of big people will be less interested if they have to make the trip to Moscow twice in such a short time frame. Don't get me wrong, I like your thinking and the third week is not an extremely bad idea. I am certain we can reach some sort of agreement here. For the sponsoring I still feel like the security and long term appeal of Boomerang is slightly better than the one time offer of Art Inc. I think it might be time to finally get the big cost of these events a bit under control with more stable sponsoring. Which brings us to the atmosphere. I have read that you would like a buffet. It is my understanding that you have already done some succesful smaller events with buffets. However, a buffet is in my opinion only fit for small events, while this is the big fish. A certain form of formality will be required of us for this event, which a buffet can't deliver. Also, you probably know of the failures of ISA when it comes to establishing an office in Moscow. I don't want to make the same mistake as before, so this time i really want to make the Russians feel more welcome. I believe this is the least the ISA jury expects of us. Granted, there are more international guests, but i don't think they would feel really comfortable either when they are in Russia and everything looks American. They will also visit the city so i don't think we should completely brake with our surroundings on this one. The Russian cooking is still in my favor, because what better way to let someone experience a culture than through food? On the same topic you mentioned DJ Happy. While I myself kind of like his music, I am afraid too many guests will also. He might get most of the attention that we both try to catch for the organistation and ourselves. Russian music is my favourite for the same reasons as the food, but I am willing to make sacrifices here for the common goal.  You finally asked me about the speech. I guess it could be alright if we did it ourselves. For the division my proposition would then be that I could start with a speech you could conclude the ceremony by handing out the awards to the most accomplished people of this year. Take your time to read over these matters an I would be very pleased to hear your thoughts on them! Greetings, Chris  
Dear Chris, Thank you for your quick response! About the dates, I think this is  much more suitable since the holidays are coming then and I am afraid that if we do it too soon or too late that our attendance will be even worse. So that is why my preference went to the 3rd week. This way we know that a lot of people will attend (more than the other weeks). I do understand where you are coming from with the sponsoring although my preference is still Art inc. I do understand that a long term partner gives more security. The catering and music will be something to further elaborate on. Last year we had people being bored because the music was boring and we want people to be uplifted and happy. So my preference stays with DJ Happy. In addition, the catering would be more suitable for eveyone if it was international. A lot of people attending are not Russian and we want to give them the oppertinity to choose food they like. With an international buffet they can eat Russian as well as cuisines from other countries. I am willing to let you do the opening speech if you want to do that the best. I hope that we can meet somewhere in the middel for everything! A nice day to you Chris!   Greetings!  
Dear Alex, First of all, sorry for not being able to answer you yesterday. I am still excited about the event though! I read your response and I agree that it should be possible to meet somewhere in the middle for everything.  For the music, I feel like the exact middle coiche of the pop band would make us both feel a little unsatisfied and, while in my opinion they are better then the DJ because they would run away with less attention, there should be a better solution than that. Therefore, for the atmosphere business, this is my proposition: We have both quite extreme ideas so instead of meeting in the middle for the two matters seperately, why not both choose one of our preffered elements? Since there are two things to decide on in this case I think this will be the fairest solution and make us both feel good for getting something out of this. With this in mind I will agree on DJ Happy if you can agree on the Russian food.  Then there would be the time and the sponsor left. I think we can fix something similar here too. I look forward to hear again from you soon! Next time I promise to answer faster. Greetings, Chris      
Dear Chris!   Thank you for your response, I do think that it is fair that you choose the cuisine and then I will select the musician for the event. As far as the time goes, week 3 has still my preference unless you think another time would be more suitable. Maybe if I select the sponsoring then you will choose the time for the event? Then I think we will have everything covered for the event :) I seem to remember that you would like week 4 the best? So i put that in my offer! let me know what you think   Greetings,   Chris
Dear Alex,  I am pleased that the hardest part of our event is over with the food and music taken care of. As it looks now you and I both have some of what we wanted for these two parts of the offer. Actually, week 4 would only be marginally better for me than the third one. Is there really no way that you can allow the Boomerang sponsor? I would be glad to let the event go through on the week you prefer if you could. Greetings, Chris
Dear Alex,   I really think that Art inc.is the best sponsor for this event since they provide us with enough finance. this will allow us to make everything possible for the event and show people what we can accomplish on short notice. So I really want Art inc. to be our sponsor. We can do the event in week 4. I hope this will be fair for both of us since you'll get the speech, date and russian cuisine and I will decide on the sponsoring and music.    Greetings,   Alex
Dear Alex, I think you would be right about Art Inc if we just had to plan the event without future prospects, but we haven't even been chosen to do the project yet. It seems to me that getting the longterm deal of Boomerang is crucial for getting the jury's attention and with it the right to plan the event. And if we can't do the event planning, all of our effort here will have been for nothing. In that view I am prepared to give up on the speech although I would be giving in quite a bit on both the date and the presentation with this. I will grant you those for the common goal but that is the furthest I will be willing to go in it. I hope you can agree with this way of things. Greetings, Chris  
We have a deal! Have a great day Chris!
Hello Chris, I hope you do well since our last encounter. As for my part, I am doing well :) Last time, we already settled some organisational issues but there are still some agenda points unsettled. I think we should start by clarifying the basic questions ï¿½whoï¿½ and ï¿½whenï¿½. More precisely, ï¿½Sponsor Selectionï¿½ and ï¿½Date of Conferenceï¿½: Sponsor Selection: As you know, Art Inc. made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event. Boomerang also made a very good offer, but offered slightly less money for the event. However, Art Inc. should be considered as the best option when making this decision. They have supported the ISA for a long time and therefore I am sure that their support will continue in the future ï¿½ unless they change their mind. Selecting Boomerang ï¿½ a direct competitor of Art Inc. ï¿½ could be such a reason and consequently I am definitely preferring Art Inc. over Boomerang and especially over the other two offers which are even lower.   Date of Conference: The CEO of ISA gave us a timeframe of five weeks during which the conference has to take place, however some dates are conflicting with other events or situations which have to be taken into consideration: Week 1:  The International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow, one of the biggest business conferences in Russia, takes place at week 1. Week 2: Some of ISAï¿½s higher ranked members ï¿½ among others, the organisationï¿½s vice presidentï¿½ are unavailable and therefore would not be able to join the event.  Week 4: Since the event is going to take place in December, I would say it would be more considerate of us to have the event in the first half of the month. Week 4 would be very close to the Christmas holidays. I know we are an International Organisation but most of our members, offices and partners are within Europe and hence we should respect Christian holidays.  Week 5: This week would be right around Christmas and consequently I believe that this time slot is definitely the worst option. If we use the method of elimination, only week 3 remains which should be the most suited time when taking everything into consideration.   Since impartially, these are the best solutions for both of us, I believe that you will agree with me concerning the issue ï¿½Sponsor Selectionï¿½ and ï¿½Date of Conferenceï¿½. Hence, you can choose our next issue(s) to talk about.   Best Regards, Alex.
"Hello Alex, I am doing fine, thank you. Great to hear that you are doing well too and thank you for taking the initiative to discuss the remaining parts of our agenda. I feel very enthusiastic to work with you. As you might know, we will be evaluated on our cooperation, so I hope we can come to an agreement together.   I indeed took notice that Art Inc. and Boomerang made some great offers. However, the other offers are also competitive and at this stage I do not yet want to rule them out. I can see your point concerning Art Inc. They have made an attractive offer now and have been a reliable partner in the past. However, I understand that Boomerang offered only slightly less than Art Inc., but are willing to offer us a long-term contract. I think this is an interesting option. It will provide security for the ISA in the future. I think this is especially important in the case of Rusia because, as you might know, an earlier attempt to establish an office over there failed in 2004. Therefore, I think we should seriously consider the long-term options because they will provide a certain degree of security. Art Inc. has been a good supporter, but as you said, they might change their mind. What do you think of the other offers, when you take into account the long-term perspective that I have outlined above? For now I choose Boomerang, but I am curious to hear what you think about the others.    I can follow your train of thoughts concerning the schedule. For me, week 1 would be an option because I am convinced that most (Russian) have enough employees to send to both the conference and the ISA event. Also, I think that week 4, even though it is close to Christmas, it is still manageable. Apart from that, I agree with you that organizing the event in week 2 or 5 would be inconvenient. Week 3 is a good option. But as I said, I do not rule out week 1 or 4 either.   What do you think about the music act? Personally, I think it would be wise to hire a local Russian band. The goal is to establish good relationships with local organizations. Therefore, I believe that we should show that we appreciate the Russian culture. What do you    A think the Russian cuisine would also be a good choice for the catering. We do celebrate our 40th anniversary and in my opinion, we should choose something special that will set this event apart from other ISA events.   Finally, we should agree on the presentation tasks. I thought about some options: 1) hiring a third person to do this (this will save a lot of time); 2) share all activities (so that we divide the workload and not spend too much time on it); 3) I do the opening speech, you do the awards.  How do you feel about this issue?   Please see my counteroffer. I am looking forward to hearing your ideas.    Best regards, Chris"
"Hi Chris, At first I apologize for answering a little bit late. I actually wanted to answer you this morning but I had to take an exam and afterwards I had to work. Now back to our topic: Sponsor Selection: It is a short-time payment from Art Inc. but it has always been one. They have always supported the ISA even without a mandatory agreement. It is like a tacit consent. As I mentioned in my last mail, they only would change their mind if we give them a reason and choosing Boomerang is such a reason. Furthermore, over the years ISA and Art Inc. became good partners and I believe we cannot afford to lose a long lasting partner. In the end, Art Inc. will pay as long as Boomerang because it has always been this way and we will be able to keep an old partner by accepting their offer.  Catering: I understand your point of view but there is something real important missing: ISA is a MULITNATIONAL organisation which is only so successful because of its NETWORKING and ACQUAINTANCES which requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. Consequently, having a very formal three course meal where everybody sits down for several hours with the same people goes completely against that idea. In almost the same manner, it would be disadvantageous just having a national buffet, precisely just having a local Russian cuisine. It would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like :) Music Act: If you accept the Catering condition, I would be willing to accept a local russian band as a compromise. Then we will have something international and something Russian in our agenda :) Presentation Task: I would prefer to switch the roles but the most important thing is that we both make a profesional teamwork appearance. I like you and because of your openness and I will agree with your proposal concerning this issue AND I will tell you a ""private information"":  I contacted Andy, who is Dr. Illenschitzï¿½ assistant. I met Andy at an ISA Christmas party a few years ago. Even though he was very hesitant to talk about anything work related, I was able to get some information on the job selection process. Whilst Andy does not know whether only one or two jobs will be offered to the best performing team, he told me that the first selection criteria is the team performance. The second criteria for the job selection is the individual negotiator performance within the winning team. Consequently we should really focus on our teamwork. Don't forget: Teamwork makes the dream work ;) I will try to check the Negoisst System twice a day. Have a nice evening and best regards Alex :)"
Hi Alex, Thanks for your reply. No worries, we still have some time to finish our discussion. I took notice of your offer and find some items very reasonable. However, some others I would like to discuss again.   I am willing to go along with your suggestion for a  local Russian band and an international buffet. I appreciate it that you are willing to let me do the presentation, and, therefore, I shall accept your suggestion to organize the event in week 3. However, I am not very happy with your suggestion for the sponsor deal. To be honest, Art Inc. is not a very attractive option for me, and I do find this quite an important item.   Since you have been honest with me, I will do the same. Not all the suggestions that you made are that attractive for me, but I do find the sponsor deal so important that I am willing to go along with your suggestions for the items regarding music act, presentation tasks, date of the conference and catering under the condition that we can rediscuss the sponsor contract. As I said before, Art Inc. is not very attractive to me. Looking at the long-term, I would like to suggest to pick either Boomerang or Corporate Ltd. Boomerang made an interesting offer because they are offering a long-term contract that will help the ISA a lot. I also find Corporate Ltd. interesting because their offer is competitive and I am very interested in working for this organization in the future. As you can see, I am more focused on the long-term. Which one of these would be most interesting for you?     In sum, I think we are very close to reaching an agreement if we could agree to meet in the middle about the sponsor deal. Please see my counteroffer and let me know what you think.    Best regards, Chris
Hi Chris, I am willing to rethink the issue concerning the sponsor selection since it is very important for you: As your first offer contained Boomerang and in my point of view Corporate Ltd. is the least favorable option, I think Boomerang is a good compromise. I think this concludes our negotiation and I'm looking forward to our presentation with pleasure :) Kind Regards, Alex 
Hi Alex, Thanks for your understanding. I am very happy with this and agree with you that it concludes our negotiation. Great that we could work this out so quickly. Thank you so much for the great communication! Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris, how you doing? After our meeting you know there are still some aspects that need to be discussed. Enclosed you find my offer. Have a nice day! Regards, Alex Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  
Hi Alex,  I am fine and how are you? In your offer I do agree on week 3 for the date of the conference. However, I believe we should go for Russian theme in the catering and music act to show ISA's interest in the local Russian culture. Also for the sponsor selection Boomerang would be a better choice in my opinion for further cooperation with the same sponsor.  Regards,  Chris Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hi Chris, thank you for your answer. I'm fine, too. It's nice to hear that we came to an agreement concerning the date of conference on week 3. So there are still 4 aspects to be determined. As for your counteroffer I can understand you in some way. You consider the collaboration with Russian business people as a sign of showing interest in the local Russian culture. But we should not forget that the ISA is a student organisation. Therefore we should cater to our client base and these are the students. If we can get students (the future talents) interested in the ISA, then the business partners will automatically work with the ISA to get easier access to these talents. Attracting students implicitly means attracting businesses! Thus, collaborating only with local Russian business people is a sign of distancing ISA from its roots and motives. I propose the following: International buffet: Many of the guests are unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine. It is smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like, both Russians and the others. DJ Happy: DJ Happy is a very famous performer who would be perfect for this event. His presence will atract many guests, which could in turn be interested in the ISA. Sponsor Selection: As you know, Art. Inc. have supported us in the past for a long time and the good lasting relationship should not be forgotten. Art. Inc also made the best offer which is higher than the offer of Boomerang. I mean, this speaks for the event. But however if I accommodate your wish with regard to the sponsor Boomerang, I also expect you to accept the other points. I am looking forward to hearing from you. I am sure that we both as a team will have the best concept to organise this event. Have a nice evening. Regards, Alex
Hi Alex, It is nice to hear that you are willing to agree to have Boomerang as our new sponsor.  However, I do not totally agree on the other points you suggested. With regard to the catering. I understand that we do represent the roots and interests of the ISA, but it is also the case that this is a big and very important event for the future of ISA. It is a bigger event than previous events like for example a couple of conferences the last few months. This is the 40th anniversary of the ISA and with this event comes a certain prestige. Therefore, I think it is a better idea to go for a three course meal rather than a simple buffet. I do agree that it can be an International three course meal. However, supporting the local Russian culture is also important in this event. If we do not represent this in the catering, we could represent this with the music. A local Russian band could play. This way we honor the local culture and we could establish a good relationship with local companies and officials, which is also important for the future relationships of the ISA in Russia. DJ Happy could overshadow the importance of the event with his presence and it could distract everyone from the main event.  I am looking forward to hearing from you and I am also confident that we as a team will have the best concept for the event with our shared ideas.  Regards, Chris
  Hi Chris,   there is a misundertanding. I told you the following in my last mail: If I accommodate your wish regarding the sponsor selection, I expect you that you accept the other points. That means, provided that you accept the other points, I am prepared to agree on Boomerang. Otherwise I have to rethink about my offer regarding Boomerang. However, you did not comply with none of my conditions in your last mail. So you do not leave me with no other option but to make the same offer again.   I am aware of the importance of this event as ISA will celebrate its 40th anniversary. For this reason a three course meal is very simple and very formal where everybody sits down for several hours with the same people. Having a buffet during which you would be free to move around and talk while eating would be much more better.   As I mentioned in my previous mail, I oppose the Russian atmosphere becuase of the reasons already stated.   I am looking to hearing from you a better offer.   Regards,   Osman  
Hi Alex, I am willing to agree with one of your other points, but all of the other points for you to agree with one of my points I will not do. I propose the following:  Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Regards, Chris
"Hi Chris, Fine, we took a step forward. I would only accept your proposal in respect of ""the music act: local Russian"", if you accept my offer regarding ""presentation tasks"". Otherwise we need to review these two points. Regards, Alex   Music Act: Local Russian bandPresentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris"
Hi Alex, I accept your last offer. I am very glad we have come to an agreement. I think this will be an original concept for the event and that we have a good chance of winning the competition. I enjoyed cooperating with you and I'm looking forward in cooperating further with your for the event. Regards, Chris
Greetings Chris, I hope all is well with you. I took a long time to look at the details about this conference. I arrived at what I think is a good solution and plan for the logistics of this conference that we need to finalize . Look what I have sent you and tell me with what you think. Talk to you soon, Alex
Hi Alex, Thanks for your message. I have read your offer for the multiple aspects of this openings- and anniversaryparty. I agree with you on the Date of Conference: Week 3 , but I still would like to discuss some other things with you.  First, I would like to talk with you about the Catering: local Russian cuisine . I think we must serve the guests a menu with local Russian cuisine, to show appreciation to the new Russian members and guests and no international buffet, because thats too simple since there will be a lot of important guests Furthermore, I don't think we should ask DJ Happy to perform, because I think his reputation maybe will overshadow the reputation of the ISA and will distract attention from the event towards the music act. Instead, we can invite another Music Act: Local Russian band . I do not know much about this local Russian band, but as long as the local opinion of the guests on the band is good and their songs are not too controversial, I only have very few additional requirements for them. Then I would like to discuss the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  . I think it is better when we could select Boomerang although they offer slightly less money than Art Inc, because they are willing to sign a long-term contract with ISA which gives us some financial security in the future.  When you could agree on the terms above, I am fine with the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   I hope to hear from you soon!   Greetings, Chris  
"Thanks for your message. Good to know you agree with me on the Date of Conference: Week 3 .   I am only willing accept your proposal of boomerang as the main sponsor, only if you consider my following opinions on the following two details!   For the Catering: local Russian cuisine and Music Act: Local Russian band for me is impossible to accept. I understand the desire to promote Russia on that day but as it is right now, we are an international organization, with diversity across many cultures; each is different and having diversity is part of culture as an organisation.   Therefore I propose to maintain international buffet, which certainly favorisse negotiation and proximity between guests. As for the music if you estimate Dj Happy Will overshadow the reputation of the ISA. Then I suggest you for the Music: Free life I hope to hear from you soon! Greetings Alex"
Hi Alex, Nice to hear from you again. I will accept the Catering: International buffet you came up with, although I am not totally agreeing with that. I can only accept that when we choose the local Russian band as the music act Music Act: Local Russian band . I think there must be some aspect that brings the Russian flavour to the conference to show the Russian members and guest some appreciation. I am convinced this will give a good first impression to the Russian members and guests and this will improve the future relationship between the guests and the ISA. So, when the Catering: International buffet  isn't Russian, I think the music must beMusic Act: Local Russian band  .   I hope you can agree with me on this and hope to hear from you soon! Greetings, Chris
Hi  Chris. I have the pleasure to say you I accept this agreement. I think on this deal everyone found his own interest. Hopefully this event will be a succes. Greetings Alex  
" Hello Chris, how are you? Thanks for the good colloboration lately for our event. As you know we have already settled some issues for the conference. But there are still some aspects that we need to clarify. So let us first clarifly ""when"" and with ""who"". Therefore the two main points are in my opinion the ""Date of Conference"" and the ""Sponsor Selection"".   Date of Conference The CEO give as a timeframe of five weeks during which the conference has to take place.  Week1: In this week the conference would collide with the International Conference on Economics and Business Managment in Moscow. Week2: At week two are some higher ranked ISAs (among others the organisation vice president) members are unavailable and cannot join the event.  Week3: There would be no others events or restriction as I know. Week4: Week four is very close to the Chrismas holidays, so i think this is not very useful for the companies and people with family. Week5: This week would be right around Christmas and companies often celebrates their christmas party or the employees go on a vacation. Additional many people want to drive home to their families. To sum up, I would prefer week three. In the other weeks there are always some restrictions and they would not be perfect for the participants.   The other main point which we need to clarify is the Sponsoring. As you know we only observe 4 sponsors into closer consideration as the main sponsor. Art Inc. made the best offer in short-term payment directly. Boomerang made us also a good offer, but slightly less money for the event, but they are willing to sign a long-term contract. This would provide a financial security for the future. Corporate Ltd. and Documenta made us lower offers. I think Art Inc. have supported the ISA for a long time and they also made the best offer. Therefore Art Inc will be the best selection. I hope you will agree me in this points.   Thanks in Advance   Kind regards Alex    "
Hello Alex,   Iï¿½m doing really well, thank you. I would also like to thank you for the last few week. Our collaboration is going great so fare. Only a few more thing that we have to settle. Thanks for the offers that youï¿½ve made thus far. I agree that week three would give us the best date for the event, since there are no restrictions and everybody is available.   I slightly disagree on the sponsoring part. Let me first say that Corporate Ltd. And Documenta indeed have made low offers. It is there for not necessary to take them in to consideration. Art Inc. and Boomerang is another matter. Although the offer of Art Inc. is higher, Boomerang guarantees us more financial stability in the future. This would be great for ISA and I think that we need to look further in to the future than just this event. In other words: they offer us more in the long run. We donï¿½t know what Art Inc. will do in the future, so Boomerang is a safer bet.   I would like to discuss one more thing with you regarding food. I think food is important and I think it is a great way to make our Russian guests feel at home and to convert them to join our couse. If we really want a chance at contracting some local businesses, we need to be able to talk to them. I think they would really appreciate a more formal dinner. So my suggestion is to give a formal Russian dinner. That way they feel more at home and at ease and it gives us great chances to talk to them.   I hope you will agree with me and can find yourself in my argumentation.   With kind regards,     Chris
"Hello Chris, thanks for your fast and friendly reply. Fine that we agree in the point ""Date of Conference"". For the Sponsor Selection we should be aware, that if we select Bommerang, Art. Inc. will not support us in the future. Art Inc. supported the ISA for a very long time and we have a very good relationship. Bommerang is a direct competitor, therefore Art Inc. will not support any other events if we select Bommerang.  For the catering I have a different view. In my opinion the conference should be have an relaxed and easy-going atmosphere, so that the participants can easy networking. Therefore, I think having a buffet is the best. The guests would be free to move around and talk while eating would be much more relaxed. Also we should choose an international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. The international mixture also contain some specialties from the Russian cuisine. So the guests can taste some specialties but also find usual meat. I think this would suit better to our multi-cultural event.  Iï¿½m also prepared to accept compromises. If it is okay for you, I will accept that we choose Bommerang as Sponsor and in return we take the international mixture buffet as catering. This would be a good solution for both of us I think. Another unsolved point is the music act. Such a great event need a good music act. Over the last years, I noticed an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts at the ISA events. Therefore, I think that some currently famous act would be exactly the right. I know DJ Happy, he is a very famous performer and would be perfect for this event. Regularly he fills huge venues with his events and I`m sure that his presence will attract many guest. Also he would be exactly the right person for such a multi-cultural event. His popularity and his music style is well-suited for our event.  Thanks for your reply in Advance. I hope we will find a good solution. Best regards, Alex"
Hello Alex,   Thank you for your reply and counteroffer. I think the negotiation is going great so far.   I am aware of the fact that Art Inc. has been related to us for a long time. I am, however, not sure that they will not want to support us in the future. The contract with Boomerang is for some period of time. After that we can look again. In the mean time we will have more certainty in our financial stability. Iï¿½m glad to hear that you are willing to adapt my point of view on this.   Concerning the catering, I have a few remarks. I think you are right when it comes to the choice of food. Maybe it is best not only to focus on local cuisine but to give everybody something of their liking. I still think it is better to make it more formal, rather than informal. There are a lot of business big shots coming to this event. I think it would not be appropriate to do a buffet and let than wander around. These people are rich and live a very luxurious life. I think therefor it would be better to serve them an international three course meal. By doing this we can also ensure that they talk to ISA people, which we cannot if they wander around. Maybe you have a clearer view on this topic so Iï¿½m willing to compromise on this.   Another point you were kind enough to bring up is the music act. Weï¿½ve done several event in the past were the music act got bigger and bigger. It hasnï¿½t worked out like we hoped to. We must remember that this event is about ISA. The problem with inviting an international renounced DJ is that he will draw to much attention. The evening would be about him and not about our cause. I therefor disagree with you on this point. If we do not refer to the Russian culture via the food, we must do it in some other way. I know a local Russian band who makes great music and people seem to really enjoy it. They can really bring people together and play requested hits from other artists. This would be perfect for our evening because they make great music without drawing to much attention to themselves. This means that, while they are playing, we can still talk to some of the business leaders. I hope you can find yourself in my position.   One more thing, we need to present. I know that in the past you have not always been comfortable on stage and I really like it. For some reason it is in my blood. I would really like to do the opening speech. After that there is the award ceremony. It gives you as much time on stage and is a little more safe because you can write more down and announce the winners. So, if you agree, I would like to open the event and let you handle the awards.   To sum up, We can change the dinner arrangements according to your liking. Next to that, I would like you to reconsider the music act and think about the presentation.   Thank you in advance for your reply and I hope we can come together with a satisfying outcome.   With kind regards,   Chris 
Hello Chris, thanks for your counteroffer. I think we will approach the end of the negotiation soon. From the recent events that I organized, I have the experience that a formal meal often inhibits the networking process. The guests only sit on their set tables and talk with their table neighbors. I know that many of the people are rich and live a very luxurious life. But this should not give the impression for a to formal dinner, this should be an event. Therefore, I think the best choice is the international buffet. I hope you will agree with me in this point. For the sponsoring I understand your arguments and think boomerang will also a good choice. Therefore, I think we have a good compromise with the international buffet as catering and Bommerang as sponsor.   Concerning the music act I completely disagree with you. I know that the music act got bigger and bigger in the past, but I think the problem was not the famous music act. In my opinion the problem was that the style often was not the suitable for such an event. A famous hip hop artists doesn`t match the image of ISA. But Dj Happy plays a good mixed sound that most of the guests will like. Furthermore, our event will get more attention and this will increase our interest in public. A local Russian band is a nice idea, but for an international event it will not be appropriate. Besides this I think we can also talk when DJ Happy is playing.   I know that I didnï¿½t felt very comfortable on stage in the past. But in my view this is a big chance for me. The opening speech will reach a broad audience and I can leave a lasting impression. Also it would have a high impact on my future perspectives in ISA. In addition, I can practice the speech very long and therefore I would feel very safe at the stage. Do you think that it is possible to change the sequence that I do the opening speech and you the award ceremony?   I hope we will agree soon and will find a good solutions for both of us. Thanks in advance.  Kind regards   Alex
Hello Alex, We are indeed reaching the end of our negotiations. We agree on most subjects but not on alle of them. Therefor I think we need to compromise on the presentation task and on the music act.  I Strongly believe we should have a Russian influence in the event. Russians are really sensitive about this. We need to win them over so in my opinion, this is very important. I think its great you've improved your presentation skills. So I'm willing to let you do the speech and I will do the awards. My compromise is as followed: we let the local Russian bad play and you can do the speech and I will do the awards.    Let me know how you feel on this offer.   With kid regards, Chris
Hello Chris, thanks for your offer. The final compromise is okay for me and therefore I will accept your offer. I think this was a good negotiation for both of us and we can be satisfied with the result. I hope you had as much fun as me and I`m looking forward to seeing you at the ISA event. Many thanks for the good cooperation.   Kind regards, Alex  
Dear Chris, It is my pleasure to meet you. I am very excited to cooperate with somebody who has been member for such  a long time, I am positive that my experience in event management together with your skills in sales and business communication will be just perfect match for successful competition outcome. Dr. Illenschitz has always been such an inspiration and role model for me. I would like to stress out from the start that this project is by far, most important thing in my carrier and I will give my maximum in order that our team achieves remarkable success. I hope that we share common picture and that our individual ambitions will bring best out of each of us. However, as we both invested so many years in this organisation we must have ISAï¿½s interests and wellbeing always as primary goal. This event is special in a way that is a milestone for further development of organisation as well as for opening doors of a completely new region for future student exchanges and access to new markets regarding potential business stakeholders.  Although, the success of this event will most probably be measured through growth of ISAï¿½s annual budget as well as strategic partnership portfolio increase I believe that what is really essential for this conference is that students will gain unique opportunity to develop themselves doing internships in such a big economy as Russia and also the recruitments of new talents from Russia will enlarge the organisation membership pool with significant new power and scope. Taking into consideration my previous engagement in conference management as well as my experience with delegates servicing in these kind of events I have clear idea what would be the most crucial points we should agree upon. Please take a look into my draft proposal regarding: Catering Date of Conference Music Act Presentation Tasks Sponsor Selection                    and let me know what you think of it. I know it is a short notice but I would appreciate If you could send me the reply until Tuesday, December 8th at 16h CET. And please remember, only with joint dedication and flexible thinking we can achieve great results. As Albert Einstein once said ï¿½The measure of intelligence is the ability to changeï¿½, so letï¿½s discuss all points with open mind and with goal of smartest possible solution for sides, our team and ISA. I am looking forward to receiving your reply. Best Regards, Alex
Dear Alex,  Thank you for your e-mail. Nice to meet you too. I am also very excited to cooperate with you and I hope we can mangage to design a winning concept for this event! It is great to hear that you are also very driven to achieve remarkable succes.  Unfortuntely I am not fully satisfied with your first offer but I like your approach and I think it is good to discuss all points iwht open mind and with goal of smartest possible solution for those involved. Please find my counteroffer in this e-mail.  I think it should be a good idea to find out what we both find important and what you and I find most important. What issue is most important for you? In my opinion the sponsor selection is very important. As you may know, meany companies have contacted the ISA and are willing to sponsor the event with varying amounts of money or promotional goods. I want to make sure that the financial perspective is  safe for the upcoming years and therefore I prefer sponsor Boomrang.    Hope to hear from you soon!  Best regards,  Chris 
Dear Chris, Thank you for quick reply. :) I would agree with you, for organization like ISA financial sustainability is very important factor. It enables all our projects going and broadens investments into our members. I would like to discuss this term of financial  sustainability with you. Although, Boomerang offers great amount of money and gives wonderful promises of future cooperation, at this very moment those are just promises and based on current economic situation one needs to wonder if trusting a company is wise. I mean just look at the facts, Art. Inc was with ISA during numerous years, the partnership between these two is not only based on financial support but itï¿½s a tradition for both sides. Members of ISA  recognize brand of Art. Inc as desired employer, they dream of cooperating with them. To break this tradition just based on a Boomerangï¿½s promise wouldnï¿½t be a smart decision.   I will give you one example that happened to us few years ago. On the event for exchange students that we organized one of the main sponsors was Coca-Cola. The agreed sponsorship was  based on money, sodas as in-kind and also intercultural training provided by Coca-Colaï¿½ HR  department for all participants. In last moment they cancelled the training as HR department had to finish certain project. PepsiCo, direct competitor of Coca-Cola approached us and offered to step in. We accepted without thinking. When Coca-Cola found out that they will provide money for project on which PepsiCo is involved they cancelled the whole sponsorship of the project. Moreover, they cancelled entire cooperation with ISA and we have lost one of the most important strategic partners of our organization.   Thatï¿½s why I would like to summarize all in one sentence, Art Inc. is long term partner of ISA who as well offered most money for the conference. Boomerang offered less money and potential of future cooperation. I donï¿½t think that this kind of risk will ever pay off. We simply should not turn our back to long term stakeholder for company that  we never cooperated with before. Who guarantees to us that after sponsorship of conference they wonï¿½t just let us go?  I am sorry but I strongly disagree with choice of Boomerang. I am open to hear your arguments, but please think through all the facts before your next proposal, at the end we are here for wellbeing of ISA as organization, and if financial and organizational sustainability of future projects is in our hands we need to think smart. I am very satisfied that we  reached an agreement regarding point 2- date, I agree that week 3 is good choice.   Regarding other points what do you think about discussing  point 1 - catering? Why would you suggest Russian Cuisine? Looking forward to hearing from you soon.   Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex,  Thank you for you quick response. Unfortunately I do not agree with your points to select Art Inc. as sponsor, but as we need to come to an final offer, I am willing to give you this point if you agree to a local Russian band as music act. The music act is an easy way to show ISA's interest in the Russian culture and therefore I would like a local Russian band as the music act. What think about this?  I am also glad that we came to an agreement of week 3 as the data of conference. And in response to you question, the local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. A buffet is not suitable because I expect many important people to be there who expect a certain level of formaility. A buffet is not suitable, having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes.  Please find below my couteroffer:  Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.     Hope to hear from you soon.  Kind regards,  Chris 
"Dear Chris, Thank you for your reply. I think that we are moving towards mutual understanding. Here are my thoughts, as this is the international event; most of the guests will be from abroad and only few locals. Thatï¿½s why I believe that serving Russian food while listening to Russian band wouldnï¿½t be very appropriate. We are here to celebrate ISA, to provide networking opportunities to all our members and business partners. Opening of new office is of course very significant part of it, but it is still just one segment of whole program. I think we should look the whole event in general when deciding regarding food and music. Thatï¿½s why I would suggest that we meet in half and make one international and one traditional. What do you think about that? As I see music is important for you, so I am willing to settle for international buffet and Russian music combination as there companies could move around and network, and hopefully establish new connections and partnerships. Therefore, our event could be branded well in eyes of our stakeholders and in future we could attract more businesses. Increasing ISAï¿½s partnership portfolio is from crucial interest in terms of stability of organisation.  In addition, although making speech during ceremony would be great carrier move for me I am willing to hand it to you if we settle for international buffet. Please let me know if this would be in accordance with your vision of the event. Kind Regards, Alex"
Dear Alex,  Thank you for your e-mail. I agree with you that we have to meet each other half way and with great pleasue I can say that we have come to an final agreement. Hope we are both happy with this :)  Kind regards,  Alex 
Hi Chris! I hope everything goes well for you. I would like to speak with you a little bit more about some aspects of the ISA conference which I think are still not very efficient to make this conference the best it deserves. Some of those aspects are the following ones: Sponsor selection may be the most important thing we have to think about. Such a thing is not a detail and we have therefore to engage a really good partner. Regarding the attributes of each proposition of several sponsors, I think that Art Inc. is the best one for such an event. Let me know about what you are thinkingï¿½ I know you have already thought about the catering. But I think I can help you by saying that it would be pretty to organize something which allows people to meet each other (for instance a buffet) and also allows people to eat something they like (some food must be too weird for foreigners to be eaten). If we want to make this conference a success, we have to satisfy everyone. As you should remember, the music act is also very important to get a successful event, thatï¿½s why I thought that a well-known performer would be the best solution. At least, a performer who proved that he can run the show. Concerning the date of conference, donï¿½t you think that the 3rd week or the 4th week would be great? Iï¿½m afraid other weeks wonï¿½t be good enough for several reasons (availability, holidaysï¿½). We have to take care of these information, otherwise we wonï¿½t have the possibility to go ahead into the ISA competition. Last, we have to think again about the presentation tasks. To share the activities is too complicated to make it work so I propose you that we divide the tasks in 2, that means for example you award the ISA members and I open the conferenceï¿½ I know we can go further into the competition but we have to take decisions quickly so please answer me as soon as you receive my mail. Best regards,   Alex
Hi Alex! Iï¿½m all well, hope you are doing fine as well! Thank you for making the offer, I am sure we both want to make the ISA conference a huge success. Although I agree with you in some cases, there are still a few important aspects we have to discuss. First the sponsor selection, which is as you said extremely important in this case. You think Art Inc. is most suitable for the conference, but I have to disagree with you. Although Art Inc. donates some more money than Boomerang, it is Boomerang that wants to sign a long-term contract as well. On the longer term, Boomerang will ensure us financial security. Please let me know what you think. Also, you think the buffet suits this event best. In the past, I have seen many of these conferences fail because of a buffet, which is often considered as lower-class. However, I agree with you that we need to allow people to eat something that they like. Why are we not organizing an international three course meal? Best of both worlds! I fully agree with you that we need music so that the event will result in an unforgettable experience. However, donï¿½t you think the well-known performer is too distracting? What about a local Russian performer? This way we give the Russian culture a chance, and this way the participants can focus on getting to know each other instead of being distracted by a famous person like a DJ. I agree with you that week 3 or 4 suits best. Letï¿½s make a decision and go for week 4? This way everyone has still plenty of time to prepare for Christmas! The presentation task is indeed too important to share as an activity. I therefore agree that you will do the opening, and I will award the prizes.   Let me know what you think, so we can start organizing the actual conference. Regards,   Chris Catering: International three course meal   Date of Conference: Week 4   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hi Chris ! First, I am pleased to see that we are agreeing on new issues, I think we are doing our best and we will find an agreement for each item very soon! To begin with, I would say that I am OK with you about the sponsor we have to work with and we can sign a contract with Boomerang which is meant to become, I hope so, a long-term partner. Then, week 4 is as suitable as week 3 (we have already discussed about this). It is the same for me so we can keep week 4 as the exact date of the conference. Thirdly, the way we will run the conference suits me so we can keep this way of running the show (you will award the prizes and I will do the opening). Unfortunately, there are still two issues for which I disagree your choices: Concerning the music act, Iï¿½m afraid a lot of people will dislike the performance of a Russian performer, for instance because it doesnï¿½t fit such a big event. Moreover, we have to show the international part of this event, even through the music which will be played. And even if a famous DJ is not a good solution, I think that we can hire the Pop band FreeLife which can bring a good atmosphere without distracting people from their wish to meet new faces. This Pop band is not as famous as a DJ but it can satisfy our guests. What do you think about this? Although I keep in mind what you noticed those last years about buffets, I am wondering whether an international three course meal will be efficient to help people meeting one another? Does it not have a negative effect on meetings?  I have to think a little bit more about thisï¿½ In every case, I am still hesitating between international buffet and international three course meal. I am looking forward to your answer about those last two items but Iï¿½m sure we will manage it soon! Regards,   Alex
Hi Alex, I'm glad we can agree on certain things. As I understand it now, we are agreeing on the date of the conference, the presentation tasks and the sponsor selection. However, we still disagree on two aspects: the Music Act and the catering. Since you said that the local Russian band is not a good idea, I thought it could be a good idea to use the local Russian cuisine as a form of catering. This way the visitors still get in touch with Russian culture, which I think is very important in this case. We then can use FreeLife as a Music Act which can, as you already said, bring a good atmosphere to the conference without being too distracting. Let me know what you think! Regards, Chris Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 4   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hi Chris, I read your last message very carefully and I can say that it is obvious we are understanding each other. We are agreeing on almost every items (I noticed you are OK for FreeLife), just the issue of the catering is still a disagreement point. You told me that you think that an international three course meal would be the best solution for both, donï¿½t you? In addition, it could be a way for people attending the conference to have the choice between international food and meanwhile local russian food, donï¿½t you think so? So it can help us having food which would satisfy our guests. We are on the right way of making a great agreement very soon! Let me know what you think about this last point and then we will start organizing this conference. Regards,   Alex
Hi Alex, Given the fact that we agree on almost every single item except for the catering, I am willing to agree on the international three course meal. This way we actually start organizing the conference, since week 4 is getting closer and closer. To summarize, the conference will take place in week 4 of december, sponsored by Boomerang. We will organize a three course meal, with FreeLife as a music act. You will cover the opening of the conference, while I will do the awards, am I correct? Look forward to hear from you! Regards, Chris
Dear Chris, Here is my first offer for you. I hope we can discuss the issues a lot and work together as a team. I am willing to cooperate and I will try to find a good outcome for both of us. Let me explain my issues: Catering: I think the International buffet should be the best choice. I think there will be a lot of people at the conference, whose are unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine. When we take an international buffet everybody will be able to find something he/she likes. I donï¿½t know what your interests are, but I think this should be a point where we both are happy with, arenï¿½t we? Tell me if you have a problem with this point. Date of Conference: Here I donï¿½t know what to take. What do you think? When Iï¿½m honest, I think the week 5 is a no-go. I thought about taking the first week, but I thought you could have a problem with it, when there is the International Conference on Economics and Business Management at the same time. I know you have a very ï¿½business-orientedï¿½-perception, so I wonï¿½t choose this option, although I think that this wonï¿½t be a problem, because most of the companies have enough employees to send someone to both events. Music Art: Let me know your opinion in this point. I only think the Local Russian band will be a bad choice. I visited a few events in the last time and I found out an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the current music acts at the ISA events. Presentation Task: What do you think about the Presentation Task? I think One of us should do the Opening speech. Or do you want a third person? Sponsor selection: You see I have a lot of points, where youï¿½re able to choose something youï¿½re happy with. In the sponsor selection I would be happy with the Art Inc.. I think we both can agree on that this isnï¿½t a bad choice for both of us. I hope you like my first offer and let me know if you have a problem with some issues. I hope we can find a good solution for both of us. In my opinion we have the best chances to win, if we share some information about our preferences in the issues. I am aware that I gave you a good insight into my topics, so I hope you can find acceptance for some of my needs and you exchange information with me like I did it. Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Thank you for your first offer. I am happy that you are willing to cooperate, so am I. I also think it is very important to find a good outcome for both of us. I read your explanations and I have some counteroffers. Catering: My first preference would be the local Russian cuisine in order to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. But I get your point of international food to be able to have something everyone likes. So, I will come back later to this point. Date of Conference: I absolutely agree with you that week 5 is a no-go. About the first week, I still have my doubts since employees may also like to go to the International Conference on Economics and Business Management. So, I would say week 3, then it will take place after the other conference and before the Christmas holidays. Let me know if week 3 suits you as well? Music Art: For me, this is kind of the same as my preference for the catering. The music act is an easy way to show ISA's interest in the Russian culture, that is why my first option would be a Local Russian band. But it is indeed very disappointing to hear that it would increase dissatisfaction. Therefore, I would like to propose the Local Russian cuisine as the choice of catering, whereas you may choose the Music Art, DJ Happy or Pop band FreeLife. In this way we can show half of our interests in Russian culture. Tell me what you think of this offer. Presentation Task: I agree with you that one of us should do the opening speech and the other should do the awards. Do you have a preference for either giving a speech or giving awards? Sponsor Selection: Could you explain me why you would prefer Art Inc.? My first choice should be Boomerang since they are willing to sign a long-term contract which offers us financial security. But if you have a good argument to choose for Art Inc., I am definitely willing to reconsider my first choice. I am curious what your thoughts are about my counteroffer. I would really like to see that both of us are happy with our choices. I think that I am clear about my preferences. If not, you can always ask me questions! Kind regards, Chris   Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: No Selection   Presentation Tasks: No Selection   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Dear Chris,   thank you for your quick answer. Iï¿½m very happy to hear, that you are willing to cooperate with me.   Catering: Iï¿½m happy that you are honest to me about your preferences. So I can tell you, that the International food is my first preference. This point is hard to negotiate with me. Iï¿½m open in all other issues, but this is a highly preferred subject for me. I would be able to accept some of your wishes, if you let me organize this issue.   Date of Conference: This would be a point where we can agree on, when you allow me to organize my preferred kind in the Catering.   Music Art: I know that you are interested to show the Russians that we are interested in their culture. In my opinion the atmosphere in the conference is more important than their culture issues. I think the most Russians there will be widely travelled men/women, whose want rather a nice evening than a boring one. We can discuss on this point, but I donï¿½t agree with your opinion there.   Presentation Task: Can I read in your message that you havenï¿½t any preferences there. This point isnï¿½t very important for me, but if I have to decide, I want rather do the speech than handing out the awards. I think itï¿½s fair because in this case, you will be able to handshake with some important business men and maybe they will recognize you in later meetings.   Sponsor Selection: This is a really important point for me, but Iï¿½m willing to change to Boomerang, if you come up to me in other issues like the music or the catering. I prefer Art Inc. because they supported the ISA for a long time. They didnï¿½t make a long-term contract, but I think their support wonï¿½t stop in the future, if we select them as our sponsors.   Look at my counter offer and let me know what you think. I think we both learned a lot about the other person and I am really glad that you share information with me in an appropriate way. I think weï¿½re capable of organizing a nice conference, if we work together like in the first messages.   Best regards,   Alex
Dear Alex, You are quick as well! :) Catering, Date of Conference, and Presentation Tasks: I am glad to hear that you are honest with me. I am willing to choose for the international buffet if the conference can take place in week 3 and if I can do the openings speech since the presentation task is an important point for me, even though I had not yet mentioned what my preference was. Sponsor Selection and Music Art: I still prefer Boomerang as our sponsor. If we choose them, I am willing to change my preference of music into the Pop band FreeLife instead of the Local Russian band. What do you think of this offer?  Moreover, I am also willing to change my choice of catering if you meet my other two preferences which I already mentioned above. Tell me how you feel about this counteroffer. Btw I am definitely sure that we are capable of organizing a nice conference, together!  Kind regard, Chris   Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
  Dear Chris,       nice to hear from you. I like your counter offer very much.   Iï¿½m glad that we can speak so open together. I begin to trust you. Thatï¿½s why I want to tell you something. I have a good contact in the ISA leadership. This person said to me that the first selection criteria would be the team performance. So I think weï¿½re not bad in our current position and on a good way for the future.       To get this team performance I want to know from you what is more important for you in your offer. Iï¿½m happy that weï¿½re already in common by the Catering and the Date of Conference. My favourite Music Act would be DJ Happy, but I think Iï¿½m okay with the Pop band FreeLife. I think these are 3 points we can agree on.   To the other two parts. How important is the Sponsor Selection to you? Is it more important than the Presentation Tasks? In my case the Sponsor Selection is much more important, so I think Iï¿½m ok when youï¿½re doing the Opening speech, but is the Art Inc. really no satisfying possibility for you?       Best regards,       Alex  
Dear Alex, Thanks for your counteroffer, which I like. Good to know that we are being judged by our team performance. In my opinion, we are doing good so far! Glad that we agree on the Catering and the Date of Conference! So there is only one thing left. For me the sponsor selection is more important than the presentation task. So I was thinking about it... What do you think of choosing Boomerang as our sponsor and to switch the Music Act to your favorite, DJ Happy, and to switch the Presentation task, you're doing the Opening Speech? Kind regards, Chris Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Hey Chris, this offer seems very fair to me. Iï¿½m glad we could negotiate in such a good mood and that we found a solution in such a quick time. We will rock this conference. I Hope to see you soon to realize our plans.   Best regards, Alex
Dear Chris, I,ve been studying what we have to do as a team and I send you my best options. First of all,I think that being a event of the ISA it must be a catering with international buffet just to be easier for the people of different countries the meeting. Another topic is the Date of Conference and the best option for me and I suppose that for the most of people is in the middle of December because at the beginning we don,t have enough time to organise the event and at the end Christmas is really close. On the other hand, It would be a good idea to engage dj Happy because most of the members of ISA are young people. Finally, about the presentation tasks the best option for me is speech by me and awards by you and about the sponsor selection art.inc. I hope to hearing from you.
"Dear Alex, Thank you for you offer. I agree with you on the dat of the conference, this would be the most convenient. I do not agree with you on the sponsor selection; eventhough Art inc. made the best offer in terms of short term payment, we can trust more on Boomerang, because they would be willing to sign a long term contract as well. This would be much more beneficial for us, because eventually we can make more money! I also do not totally agree with you on your choice of the catering, I understand that a buffet would be an easy choice. But in my opinion it would be strategically better to have local Russian cuisine, because in this manner we can show our appreciation of our new Russian members. I also think this is a better choice because there are important people visiting this event, so a buffet does not have the proper level of formality for this event.  I hope we can make a good decision together, and that this will be a fruitful collaboration. Kind Regards, Chris"
Dear Chris, I,ve been thinking and I finally get to  the conclusion that it would be a good better a local russian band than the local russian cuisine just if we  want   to transmit the culture  russian. There are going to be too many people for many different countries so my opinion is that all people do not really like russian cuisine and if we want the most confortable situation for them it would be a better choise to keep the international buffet and to  add the signal of Rusia we can just  choose the Local Russian band. On the other hand, I also want to change the date to the first  week because I conclude that the third week is also very close to Christmas. I hope to get early to an agreement with you. Best regards, ALEX.
Dear Alex, Thank you for understanding my choice for a Local Russian band, I think it is indeed good to keep our new Russian members happy! I get your point about the international buffet, because there are a lot of international people so maybe Russian food is not the best option. But in my opinion a buffet is too low class, so I propose we then do an International three course meal, so that it has the right amount of formality. I again want to mention the sponsor selection, because in my opinion Boomerang is the right option, like I said in the previous message. It will be beneficial for us on the long term! Boomerang might not give us the most amount of money before the event, but they will keep sponsoring us with other events. I hope we can make this an great event for the ISA together, hopefully I will hear from you soon. - chris
Dear Chris, As I can see, the most important things for you are the most important things for me and I am speaking about the catering and the sponsor selection, so keeping the others issue constant, such music act a local russian band, the date the 3rd week and the presentation tasks speech by me and awards by Chris and the music act by dj happy, we just have to decide the sponsor and the catering. I prefer the Art Inc and to add the russian topic in the catering the local Russian cuisine. Best regards, ALEX  
"Dear Alex, I am a bit confused about your message.. you say that we have to keep some issues constant like music act (a local russian band), the date (3rd week) en the presentation task (speech by you and awards by me), on which I agree. Then you say the music act needs to be DJ Happy, while you just said russian band, so are contradicting yourself.  You say you prefer Art inc. but please explain to me why, I told you for a few times now why I prefer Boomerang; because it will be beneficial for us on the long term.  So I propose that we keep the Russian cuisine (to keep our new Russian Members happy), we keep week 3 (because this is for the both of us a good option), than I will give in on DJ happy (I think there is a better choice, but I want to give in to you a little bit), I give you the speech and I take the awards, eventhough this is a bit less important. But because I give in on the speech and on DJ Happy, I think it would be fair for that you give in a bit too and that we choose Boomerang as a sponsor.  I hope this offer will be satisfying for you, and hopefully we can get to an agreement Kind Regards Chris"
Dear Chris, how we have to get to an agreement as soos as possible, I let you decide the sponsor and I decide the catering. Remember that we are a team and we have to think in the benefits of both. I hope that this will be the last offer, because it must have been finish before 4 pm. Best regards, ALEX
Dear Alex, You say we have to work as a team, but the offer you are making me now is not fair. You say I select the sponsor and you the catering. But you select the presentation task and the music act as well.  So this is my final offer, I give you the presentation task and the catering, but then I really want the Local Russian band, because I believe we need to have a Russian influence somewhere. In this offer, both our preferences are equally divided. Hopefully this will lead to an agreement. Kind Regards Chris
Dear Chris, that,s ok. Glad to negotiate with you. Best regards, ALEX
This is my offer of negotiation. I hope it's all okay. Kind regards, Alex.  
Dear Alex,  I agree to plan the conference in week 3. Thus, this is fine by me. Furthermore, i partly agree with the international food. I would only like to have a international three course mail. See my new offer and i hope to hear from you soon.   Kind regards, Chris   Catering: International three course meal   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang    
Catering: International buffet having a formal three course meal where everyone sits down for several hours with the same people I think not is good. The conference should have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances which requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. If you have a buffet during which you would be free to move around and talk while eating, it will be much more relaxed. In addition, everybody is able to find something they like. Music Act: DJ Happy I think that DJ Happy would be perfect for this event. This DJ regularly fills huge venues with his events and you are sure that his presence will attract many guests. It is the option more international. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris I prefer give the opening speech. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang Art Inc. make the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event. And Boomerang also make a very good offer, but offered slightly less money for the event. However, they also say that they would be willing to sign a long-term contract. In this contract, they would ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. Such a contract would provide financial security for several upcoming ISA events and to some extent for the ISA itself. So, for me is good choose Boomerang too. Kind regards, Alex.  
Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Music Act: Local Russian band   Catering: local Russian cuisine     Dear Alex,   Thank you for your offer. I am happy that you agreed with the sponsor. I have some other offers for you. I dislike the buffet because that is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. Furthermore, the guest will expect a certain level of formality. If you donï¿½t like the three course mail, we can do the Russian cuisine? I think the Russians would appreciate this. I think that music is an easy way to show ISAï¿½s interest in the Russian culture and I think we can do this with an Russian act. I think we need to focus on the strategy of the event and that we should focus on the relationship with companies and officials. DJ Happy would not be a side-act. This act would attract to much attention and there is no guarantee that his reputation would not overshadow the reputation of ISA. Maybe I can do you an offer you would like. I would also like to give the opening speech and maybe we can do both some concessions if you like. If we hire a Russian act, you can give the opening speech and I will do the award.   Kind regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, I have some other offers for you too. For example, the catering, I still think that it is better a buffet. But, I donï¿½t seem bad idea the three course mail. I think that the guests get food they like too.   And about music art, I prefer DJ Happy. But, I think that Pop band FreeLife could be enough to keep the guests satisfied.   But we can continue with the negotiation about catering and music art.   Kind regards, Alex
Music Act: Local Russian band   Catering: International three course meal   Dear Alex, I still think it is better to have something Russian during the event because the Russians would appreciate this. Maybe we can meet each other in the middle? We can do the International three course meal and ask the local Russian Act as music act to perform. Or on the other way around, we can choose for the music act FreeLife (I agree with FreeLife because I this this is a better option than DJ Happy) if the catering will be the Russian cousine? Kind regards, Chris  
 Dear Chris,   I am agree with you about have something Russian during event. I think that the music is better, because this it will create a pleasant environment. What do you think? But, about the catering, I still think that is better a buffet, because everybody is able to find something they like.  Music Act: Local Russian band  Catering: International buffet   Kind regards, Alex  
Dear Alex, I will accept your offer. Kind regard, Chris
Hi Chris,   my name is Alex and Iï¿½m your team partner for the upcoming ISA competition. I hope youï¿½re doing well. Iï¿½m really looking forward to work with you on the concept for the celebration of the ISA anniversary and the opening ceremony of our new subsidiary in Russia. I think itï¿½s a very honorable and important challenge for both of us. So letï¿½s use this chance and outperform the other teams with a significant and excellence team work and of course catch the job offers.   As I see we have a few discussion points about which we have to talk with each other. Therefore, we should really focus on establishing a successful event in Russia and stick to the vision and concept of the ISA. Everyone of us has a slightly different area of expertise. So we should use this as our advantage and derive the best design concept out of it. In general, Iï¿½m very experienced in organizing such impactful events, since I joined ISA.   In my opinion itï¿½s important to show our current and possible prospective Business Partners and other stakeholders the international and unique impactful, young spirit of ISA. This event helps us on one hand to establish our organization in Russia but on the other hand to prove our successful business model to all our stakeholders. So of course the opening of our new subsidiary is very important but the focus should be more broad, international and about the ISA itself. We will have many important longterm members and Buiness Partners at the celebration.   In order to work very structured and efficient I would like to split up our discussion points to focus on the individual topics. So I would like to talk about the Date of the Conference   and the Sponsor Selection first.   Regarding the Date of Conference: Week 3   I would prefer the third week. The other options conflict with other events and many important people from the business and ISA could not participate. And of course Christmas is very close. So we should focus on the third week. The Question who will be the main sponsor of the event is not that easy. I would focus on Art Inc. and Boomerang, because they made quite a good offer and we have a future with these partners. As I see were working quite well together with Art Inc. they would be the best sponsor for our 40th anniversary of ISA, because they represent for what we stand for. So let's pick  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  and set up a succesfull event with them.   I hope youï¿½re doing well with this procedure and we will create the best concept and win this competition together.   Best regards, Alex
Hi Alex! I'm doing fine! You to, I hope? I also think it is a great opportunity for the both of us to organize this event. In my opinion it is especially important to include the local culture of Russia. The success of ISA is for a large part due to the inclusion of cultural aspects in our events. I think it is important to keep the focus small and not so broad, because we already proved our capacities etc. to important longterm members and Business partners. Of course, there is also the celebration of the 40th anniversity of ISA, but I really think that it is also important to include the Russian culture because it is of course also the opening of a new subsidiary in Russia.  I think it is a good idea to split up the discussion points! It is more clear in this way! I agree with you on the date of the conference! I also think that the third week is the best choice, because otherwise it becomes to difficult Date of Conference: Week 3 . Regarding the sponsor selection, I do not completely agree with you. I also think that Art Inc. and Boomerang are the best options, but an advantage of Boomerang is that they can give us a longterm contract and they are willing to sponsor us for future events. I know that Art Inc. also sponsored us in the past, but they can't give us assurance on future events: Boomerang does. So my preference with sponsor selection is Boomerang:  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   I find it really important that we find a good sponsor and that we can keep this sponsor. Art Inc. offers us a slightly higher payment than Boomerang, but this difference is very small. Boomerang can offer us long-term financial security and I think that is very important for our company! I also add the Catering in this negotiation. I prefer to have a local Russion cuisine. I already said that it would be nice to add some cultural aspects into the event and a Russian cuisine would be a nice option to do this. We can show that we have a cultural view and that we are open to new flavours and new ideas. That is a good message to come over with.  I don't want a buffet, because I expect there to be important people and they will expect a certain level of formality. Catering: local Russian cuisine   I have one small problem for the deadline of the negotiation. I am going to Madrid this weekend and I leave on Thursday evening, so it would be great if we can come to a conclusion before this evening!:) Best regards, Chris
Hi Chris, thanks for your response. Iï¿½m doing well. Itï¿½s great to have an agreement on the Date of Conference: Week 3. Now we can focus on the other topics. I would definitely agree with you on local, Russian culture oriented celebration if it would be just the opening ceremony of the subsidiary. But this time itï¿½s a very special case and we should be more open-minded. So regarding the catering selection I agree to integrate the local Russian cuisine at some point. But in general the Russian cuisine is very special with e.g. Okroshka or Pirozhki. In order to satisfy all our guestsï¿½ needs, respectively a lot of important international ISA members and business partners, I would definitely choose the international buffet for our catering. Of course an international buffet includes also some of the local Russian food. So this would perfectly fit to our needs by the integration of the local culture. And we can combine this local culture with our own ISA young spirit by choosing a buffet and not a formal three course meal. I think weï¿½re pretty good comparable with a Start-Up company. So on one hand weï¿½re really innovative, youth-driven (buffet) but on the other hand weï¿½re business-oriented (international buffet to satisfy all our stakeholders). So the buffet and the international orientation does not interfere with the integration of the local culture. Russia wants to be a global player and we should show them that weï¿½re able to deliver this global context. Catering: International buffet   Regarding our second point (sponsor selection) I definitely understand your thinking. The future of ISA is very important, but we should look back and asked our self who supported us to be as successful as we are today. Partners like Art Inc. helped us over years to grow, improve and establish our business model. So in general the small difference of the amount of money, doesnï¿½t matter to me. Imagine you support somebody over years and at the 40th anniversary you get exchange with somebody you do not even know. Letï¿½s think strategic in this case and not to monetary. If we prove our reliability to Art Inc. And Iï¿½m sure they will definitely sign a long-term contract after the event. Or do you have arguments which contradicts this thinking out of your experienced business partner perspective? Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.     Iï¿½m looking forward to your answer. Best wishes, Alex
"Sorry for my very late reaction! I still hope we can come to a conclusion today.. I understand your vision on the catering. Although I think we are not comparable with a start-up company like you said; we are an established company for 40 years so people will expect a lot from us. So I can possibly agree with you on the international buffet, but I still think we need to add some more cultural aspect into the opening so then I like to have a local Russian band playing at the opening. Then we still have some Russian influences into the opening and we can inspire all the people at the conference with this choice. Maybe not everyone likes the music, but the same will hold for the other two acts and thus I like to see a local Russian band at the conference. Then I can agree with the International buffet. With the Russian band we can show that we are open to new influences and that we give small acts the chance to show themselves. The songs of the band are also not to controversial and they do not overshadow the event. The other two acts may overshadow ISA and that is not what we want. I still can't agree with you on the sponsoring. You say that it is a monetary thing to me, but it isn't. Boomerang is even giving us some less money than Art Inc. so I don't think monetary, but just strategic. I want our company to grow in the future and that is possible with this sponsor, because they will support us in the future. I think we don't have to look back to what the past show us, it is important to look forward into the future and there is no guarantee that Art Inc. will stay sponsoring us. With Boomerang we do know this. Then the last item on the list is the presentation tasks. I think a third person is a very bad idea in all ways. It costs a lot of time and money and does not give us anything. I'm very good at speaking in public so I don't mind to do a speech and then you can do the awards? I don't know if you agree with that. So then my offer looks like this: Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Hope to hear from you soon! Chris"
Hi Chis, thanks for you message.  Iï¿½m glad to see were coming in some points to an agreement. According to our deadline I will focus on the open discussion points. So my preference on the Presentation Task would definitely to choose a third person. I see advantages for the person who is doing the speech. On one hand you will be extremely visible to the important people of the ISA and business partners and on the other hand itï¿½s a good entry for your CV and career at ISA. So in situation personally I donï¿½t want to set somebody in the focus in respect to our team. Iï¿½m mean we should be equally visible. But I also trust in your skills as a speaker and that you will deliver a good and rememberable speech. So with a lot of goodwill I would give you the honor to perform the speech, although itï¿½s definitely not my preference. Also I understand your thinking regarding our sponsor. So I relay on your experience with business partners and hope weï¿½re doing the right thing. Loosing Art Inc. would be a bitter setback. Based on this we could go with Boomerang.  But these two points (Speech and Sponsor) means for me to have DJ Happy as our Music Act. Itï¿½s an international (also in Russia) famous DJ. Russian loves to have a big and ostentatious event. If weï¿½re not able to show the Russian business men that weï¿½re willing to invest in a great music act just for them, they wonï¿½t take us serious. One could say we have to show our profitable business to them. And of course we can talk to the DJ to not overshadow the event in general, but this should be clear because itï¿½s a ISA event and not a concert. So as I said you could do the speech and we could have Boomerang as our main sponsor if weï¿½re book DJ Happy as our music act. Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang     Hope to hear form you soon, Alex
I accept this offer! I would rather see the local Russian band, but I agree on you that we can ask the DJ to not overshadow us and we can discuss with this DJ what songs he is going to play etc. I also don't like the international buffet, but you are right that it is possible that it contains Russian food too, because it is international:) It is nice to have Boomerang as a sponsor, they will be good for us and I will do my very best to give a good speech at the opening! Thank you for responding this quick and thanks for the cooperation! Best regards, Chris Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Good morning, Chris, I am your team partner for the organization of the annual conference of ISA in Russia in 2016. I think we have to discuss some aspects concerning the organization and agree on how the whole thing will proceed. These are my suggestions, which I consider most relevant. Please review them and let me know about your opinion. Yours sincerely Alex
Good morning Alex, Thank you for your message. How are you doing? I am looking forward to the event and organizing it with you. You are absolutely right, we still have to discuss the final aspects of the event.   I think you make a good point to have the event in week three. However, I do not think your other suggestions are the best fit for the opening of the new office in Russia and the celebration of our 40th anniversary. I think the event will be a greater success when we adopt local culture. A good Russion band and fine Russion food will facilitate a good relationship and bond with our future business partners in Russia. Also, otherwise the opening could just have been anywhere else don't you think.  Also, why do you think Art Inc. should be the sponsor of the event? Why do you think they are the best choise? Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Kind regards,   Chirs 
Hi again, Chris, Thanks for your fast response to my offer. So, we have one point settled - the date of conference. With respect to the catering and the music, I think that the group of people we want to gather is strongly heterogeneous, coming from all over the world, and only a  very small part of them are familiar with Russian cuisine, which may not be liked by everyone. Moreover, I think the purpose of this event is to gain new contacts and socialize, that is why I think a buffer, where everyone can move around and talk to different people is a good choice. About the music, DJ Happy is a world-known performer and since the most of our guests are going to be students, they will definitely know him and enjoy his music, while an unknown Russian band may be seen as boring by the mass. I suggested that we choose Art Inc. firstly because they made the highest offer to sponsor us from all 4 choices and secondly, becaue they have been working with ISA for several years now and we already have a strong business relation with them. But if you think otherwise, I'll be glad to hear your arguments too. Best wishes Alex
"Hi Alex, Get ready for a somewhat extensive reply. Sorry for that ;) I disagree with you regarding the food. The most important thing is to attract new business partners, which are Russian. Therefore, I think serving Russian food will be valued strongly. Also, it is a nice way to introduce ISAï¿½s new country and its culture to ISAï¿½s community. Next to that, Russian food is actually really delicious and more known than you would expect. I donï¿½t know how familiar you are with the Russian cuisine, but you can think of a lot of dishes that are Russian which are not necessarily unknown or complete ï¿½different from the standard/normï¿½.  For instance: caviar is very popular in Russia. Also dishes like Plov (a rice dish with meat and vegetables), Vareniki/pierogi (Russian kind of dumplings), boeuf stroganoff are just a few international accepted and popular Russian dishes. About the sponsor. You made a fair point that Art Inc. made the highest offer, however on the long run Boomerang made the best offer. Boomerang maybe offered a slightly lower amount of money for the actual event, but they would ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. Such contract will provide financial security for several upcoming ISA events and to some extent for the ISA itself. So on the long run this will be a better choice. Besides, as you said yourself Art Inc. is already a good partner of ISA. They will be cooperating and sponsoring future events most probably anyway. I agree that DJ Happy is a world-known performer, but this is also my concern. Because DJ Happy is so well-known he will overshadow the event, distracting the attention from the event towards the music act. Especially from the younger audience, which you mentioned as very important. A Russian band can also play songs in English, the songs do not necessarily have to be in Russian. There are several good cover bands that even play international pop songs on request.    - Chris Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang      "
Hi Chris, you are right in some points, but I think about the sponsor we will make a mistake if we ignore Art Inc. this time. Why do you think they will keep supporting us if we do not include them in this big event? This may break our good business relationship with them forever, especially if we hire their direct competitor Boomerang. With this in mind, still the higher payment by Art looks tempting, since we can achieve more things with more money. About the food, I do not have anything against Russian cuisine, but I still think an international buffet would serve everyone's wishes, since it can also include some Russian specialties for the people who enjoy them. Anyway, a three course meal is also an option, beacause we can order one of the meals to be typically Russian but in this case we lose the opportunity for making contacts and socializing. And the music played by a local Russian band (and in case the cuisine is also Russian) does not fit at all with the international orientation of ISA and its goals to link people from all countries. I think we should go beyond the country boundaries and offer something known worldwide. If you think DJ Happy can overshadow the event, we can hire the pop band FreeLife. It is also popular among the young but not a real sensation. What do you think about that? Best wishes Alex
" Hi Alex,  Sorry for my late response. Iï¿½ve been very busy the past couple of days. I hope you havenï¿½t worried about it. How are you doing? I have been thinking about the event  and previous ISA events a lot and I have come with a few points as well ;) I have organized and attended several events of ISA and what has got my attention is that the success of these events has, for a great part, always been due to the successful adoption of local culture. Therefore I think it is also a vital part of this event of creating a good relationship with our future business partners in Russia. So, I really think the atmosphere of the event should thus reflect some local cultural aspects while being a very enjoyable conference for all visitors. Maybe, if you think both the music and the food will be too much, we could agree to only include one Russian features. Then I would suggest to choose for the Russian cuisine and have FreeLife as the musical act during the event. What do you think of that?   About the sponsorship, I do not think a good relationship like we have with Art Inc. will be harmed that easily when it is that good as you say it is. Especially not so severe that it would break it forever. It is true that Art Inc. has sponsored before, but this does not give any guarantees for the future. This relationship with Art Inc. is only based on the sponsoring of previous events. They can always decide to change their intentions. Boomerang however can and will ensure future sponsoring and collaboration.

"Hi, Chris, I'm happy you are back. Just one point - maybe I would not be able to come online tomorrow, so i would be glad to conclude  the negotiations tonight if it is possible for you too. I agree with you that we have to merge to some extent in the local culture, but I still think the catering is a very important prerequisite for a good networking activity and it would be more beneficial to stick to the idea of the buffet. In all cases, we can include there some Russian specialties. If you are OK with that, I agree to hire a local Russian band to entertain the public with both local and famous hits. Talking about the sponsor, I think we should both consider our overall performance as a team and what is best for the event, not only our individual interests and I think the best choice for our event would be to hire a reliable well-known to us sponsor who is also ready to make the highest offer in terms of money. And what about the presentation tasks. Are you able to compromise on that, or should we think of a third party to do it, although I think we can both profit more if we participate and make ourselves known to the ""big guys""? Alex"
Alex, You're saying some contridicting things. You say we have to look at our overall performance as a team, but at the same time you stick to your opion about Art Inc. while when looking at the facts Boomerang is a better choise thus better for the team performance.  I'm glad to hear that you see that including something Russian is relevant to make the event a success. But why did you change your initial offer about the band FreeLife when I take you up to this? Because regarding the food, I just do not think a buffet is suitable for the event. Many important people will be there and they expect a certain level of formality. A buffet does not accomplish that formality. It is not just another ISA event, it is ISA's 40 year aniversiry. Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
"Hi Chris, when I meant we have to improve the team performance I meant that Art Inc. is the best choice with respect to sponsor, not for me, but for the event as a whole. Firstly, we have a long-lasting relationship with it (which we do not have with Boomerang) and it offers a higher financial support (than Boomerang). In all aspects, it is the better choice.  I changed my opinion about FreeLife because of you request to include a Russian ""part"" in the event, which can be done by hiring a local band. But if you insist on the Russian cuisine, then I suggest we hire the world-known DJ Happy. In this case, your opinion about the local presence will be satisfied and my opinion about entertainment too. I think it's a fair compromise. But on the issue of the sponsors, I think it is more than clear, which one is the best choice. Alex"
"Hi Alex, As you know I am not so happy with DJ Happy ( ;P ) Also..  I really do not see the logic in your point of the overall success of choosing Art Inc. on all topics. Boomerang offered only slighly less money BUT guarantees sponsoring (so money) in the future. Commulative this is more than what Art Inc. offers. Also because it is very likely they will sponsor in the future anyway since they are already partners. But anyway, I'll come with a compromise: We choose Boomerang as our sponsor and then you can give the speach in stead of me.   - Chris Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  "
Hi Chris, We have different views on the sponsors, but maybe this means they are both as good. I'm ready to accept your last offer only under the condition that we choose DJ Happy. I made a big compromise about the Russian cuisine, although I'm not convinced it will be liked by the majority, which will certainly be true for DJ Happy. If you are OK with that, let's have a deal.   Alex
"Hi Alex, I think we've come to a good recipe for a successful celebration in St Petersburg!  I hope you agree to that and that we can celebrate our 'victory' over the other candidates pretty soon ;)  It was nice working together with you, planning this special event! We keep in touch, - Chris"
Dear Chris, Thank you for the last meeting where we settled some important issues for the concept of the upcoming conference. I am sure that we will be a great team and will manage to convince Dr. Illenschitz with our experience, organization skills and creativity. With your long standing experience in cooperating with business contacts I am sure that we can play an important role in the competition of the concept design for the annual conference in St. Petersburg. In this context there are still five points left which we have to focus on and have to discuss.  What is your opinion referring to the sponsor selection? In my opinion Art Inc. is the right sponsor of the upcoming event because they made the best offer and have a short-term payment model for the event. We have also to focus on the music act which is a major point for the event, because it determines the whole atmosphere. Due to the high number of students participating who characterize ISA as a student association we have to think about a person who knows the preferences of young people but is as well able to respond to special requests of our business partners. I recommend DJ Happy. He is famous and well known for handling such big events. Furthermore I would like to ask you if you have any preferences referring to the opening speech and award ceremony. Another point is the date of the conference. I think it is hard to find a time where everything fits. The only week which fits best is the third week of December. The last open point is catering. In my opinion an international buffet fits best, because it allows to socialize while eating. With that we will have a more relaxed atmosphere. I would appreciate to have your feedback on the above. Kind regards   Alex
Dear Alex, It was pleasure to meet you on our last meeting. You made a nice impression on me and I will do  all the best to be great part of team and to convince Dr. Illenschitz with our experience, organization skills and creativity. The Art Inc. would give as the best offer and also has always donated some money for our events too, but unfortunately they did not show the interest to sing a contract for future events. Without a written contract regarding the future, Art Inc. can always decide to change their intentions. Therefore dear Alex, you can see that the option without future perspectives as a factor of uncertainty which can only hurt the ISA in the long run. Making the financial perspective of ISA sure is safe for the upcoming years and that`s the reason why I prefer as sponsor Boomerang over Art Inc. Refers to music, I agree DJ Happy would be very attractive, especially for the younger generation, but the strategy of the event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with local companies and officials. For ISA is very important to show interest in the Russian culture and therefore is the music act an easy way to do it. My opinion is to having a local Russian band as the music act very good solution to show the interest and also to have a fun. Catering is a very important point. Since we expect many important people to be there, who expect a certain level of formality, represents the catering the prestige of the ISA. Therefore, for the such a special event as anniversary we should to organize good catering. Having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. Same as by the music, should we organize some local Russian cuisine. The opening speech and award ceremony should represent for both of us, as organization team, some kind of prestige role and also the award for our work behind the scene. In that order I can recommend to do that together. Finally the third week is a good option because everything later is too close to Christmas.   Please share with me your feedback about the discussed. Your Sincerely Chris
Dear Chris, Thank you for your feedback and your acceptance of the date of the conference. Referring to the sponsor selection I can understand your criticism. But on the other hand Art Inc. was a very important sponsor for the last events and they ensured the required amount of money which Bommerang does not do. We have to focus on this event. It will be our 40th anniversary so we need all the money to guarantee a well-organized event. Pleaseremember the failed establishment of a new office in Moscow in 2004 because of problems in the preparation. This event should be a demonstration for all business contacts and especially for the Russian business partners, that ISA stands for high performance and a reliable and well-organized association and business partner. Money is the basis for a detailed preparation and a perfect conference. Furthermore, I am convinced that we can count on Art Inc. for the next few years as long as we give Art Inc. no reason for terminating the sponsoring. In my opinion dealing with Boomerang and selecting Boomerang is such a reason for an exit for Art Inc.. If we take Boomerang and need further support in upcoming events I am sure that Art Inc. will be none of these supporters. Regardingthe organization of the music act we should elect someone with international popularity because it characterizes ISA as an international association. It is the international presence and atmosphere the Russian companies are interested in. Only two musicians fulfil these requirements - either DJ Happy or FreeLife. The Catering is comparable to the music selection. As you mentioned there are many important people. But they come from different countries not only from Russia. In my opinion the Catering should also have an international touch to satisfy all different wishes. A buffet but would have the advantage that we can present Russian cuisine as well. What do think about a third person? Hiring an external speaker means less effort for us and we can concentrate on the organization of the event. With best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Refers to the sponsors I absolutely agree that money is the basis for a detailed preparation and a perfect conference. And that is what we want to do, perfect event. I would like to point out that with singing the long-term contract with Boomerang we would ensure some financial security for the future events. Without a written contract regarding the future, Art Inc. can always decide to change their intentions and that can only hurt the ISA. The Boomerang`s offer with slightly less money is pretty enough for our event and it is balanced by the offer of a long-term contract. Please would you be so kind and tell me more why do you think that Boomerang would not ensure required amount of money? Furthermore, if Art Inc would like to support us for the next few years, I do not see the reason, why they would not to sign the contract. Why are you so convinced that we can count on Art Inc. for the next few years? As you have mentioned this event should be a demonstration for all business contacts and especially for the Russian business partners, that ISA stands for high performance and a reliable and well-organized association and business partner. In order to show that the DJ Happy as famous international music star would sure do nice preformance and our guests would be satisfied, but I am afraid that DJ Happy would, with his reputation, overshadow the reputation of the ISA, distracting attention from the event towards the music act and that is not what we want! I can agree with you that with local band we would not actually show the international side of our Organization. Referring to my colleagues` experience the FreeLife`s music is suited to accompany the evening without being the main act and they would probably satisfy most guests. What is your opinion about the FreeLife? As I mentioned, there are many important people on our event. But they come from different countries not only from Russia. Because of that probably they would not all be satisfied with the Russian`s music. We also do not want just to create an international event too, without refering on the Russian culture. Choosing the Russian cuisine is nice way to stay in touch with the culture and to bring something new to participants. I am sure that most of them do not have an Idea about Russian cuisine and they would like to try it and enjoying. That also the way in that we show the appreciation to our new Russian members and guests too and introducing the foreigners with Russia! As I mentioned having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event but, as you know, our event is the 40th anniversary and anything less than a three course meal would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years, which werenï¿½t even some special events. That is the reason why we should organize the local cuisine. I do not think that the hiring an external speaker is a good Idea. That is true, that means less effort for us, but also the speaker could not express the satisfaction of the organization such an event if it is not a part of team. For me it would be no problem to overtake the role of speaker by organization what needs more effort, but it would be cool, if you acceppt at least to give awards!. Looking forward for your response! Chris
Dear Chris, Referring to the sponsor selection I can understand your point of view regarding to the long-term financial security. But Art Inc. was still a good business partner in the last events. So I think terminating the business relation with Art Inc. could also have future consequences in the sponsor selection once the contract relation with Boomerang ends. But all in all provided by the financial security in upcoming events and the only slightly smaller amount of money for the next ISA conference I am disposed to choose Boomerang. But referring to the cultural aspect including catering and music I still hold that we should take the international option. An international buffet does not exclude Russian cuisine but rather gives the possibility instead of a three course meal or a local cuisine to suit all tastes of the guests. In my opinion the international buffet would not be a decline from the conferencesï¿½ meal over the last few years because the dishes will not differ in quality from the three course meal or the Russian cuisine. Consequently the international buffet is the best solution to respond all different international wishes. Furthermore the buffet additionally gives the possibility, instead of the three course meal with allotted seats, to socialize with other persons. I can understand your opinion that this 40th anniversary event is a very important one but it is still an event to strengthen existing business relations and also to build up new business relations. So in this case you have to guarantee that the guests can communicate with each other and not only to the partners sitting next to them. To create a homogeneous atmosphere it is important that aside from the international buffet we also offer international music that is able to fulfill all wishes of the guest. So in my point of view DJ Happy corresponds to all these criteria. Comparable to the band he is more flexible in the selection of music. He has the ability to play all musical styles without a prior consultation and therefore he can react faster to create the best atmosphere in certain situations. Furthermore with an artist like DJ Happy who - because of his degree of popularity - can choose who he will be working with, will imply to our counterparts that ISA is an organization who is operating on an international level and taken seriously. The big advantage of an external speaker is his neutrality, so he is free from all business influences. In this case he has the possibility to represent an unbiased opinion and can address the other side of the business which will have a highly motivating impact on our guests and business partners. But if you already have an idea on how to create and structure an opening speech I have nothing to be said against that you can hold the opening speech and will take on the awarding. Thanks a lot for your previous support in the organization. Kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, I am very happy that you accepted the Boomerang as a sponsor so that the event is going on for the next few years. I understand your wish to organize international buffet and DJ Happy. In the buffet it will be served some Russians cuisine It will show the appreciation to our hosts and it is simple to have easy talks. In the end we are the Student organization so the businessmen will understand our performance and actually that event represents for them some kind of nice memories on student days. I am sure that DJ Happy will do nice show and our guests will enjoy. His popularity is advantage for us too so I can agree with you. Furthermore, it will be pleasure for me to do the speech! Dear Alex, thank you for your cooperation and I wish you all the best. Regards Chris
Good afternoon: I present my first offer, I would like to know your point of view and if you agree.   Best regards.
Dear Alex,   Thank you for your first offer. In some points your offer corresponds with my ideas regarding to the events details. I total agree with you that the conference should be scheduled in the third week of the given timeframe. I am also in favor with your idea that I will do the opening speech and you are responsible for the awards. Thus, in my opinion we can fix these two points. However, I would like two discuss the other points of the event with you in more detail. In terms of the catering, I think your suggestion of an international three course meal is suitable for this event. However, in my opinion we should show your appreciation to our new Russian members and guests by offering an excellent Russian cuisine. Another point I have to discuss is the sponsoring. We should choose a sustainable solution for the ISA. I know that Art Inc. made the best offer for this event. But our organization is not living from this single event and we should really think in long terms. I suggest that the sponsoring should be done by Boomerang. I know, that there offer is slightly lower than that from Art Inc. However, they offered us also a long term contract which is important for the future of our organisation. The last point I would like to discuss is the music act. I know that DJ Happy is a very popular and famous international DJ and personally I would also choose him. But with regard to this event we should think about a music act which does not attract all attention to itself and the real event may be considered like a ï¿½side eventï¿½. Therefore I would suggest a local Russian band to show ISAï¿½s and ours interest in Russian culture. I hope we can find an agreement for these three points to be able to suggest a good plan for this event! Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris: In my opinion , there are certain points on which I do not agree. On the issue of the food did not seem appropriate to put only Russian food , there are more international people .Then I thought it would be best buffet during which you would be free to move around and talk while eating would be more relaxed . And in the buffet we could put more Russian but also international food, because not only have to think of the Russians.   Regarding the art music I still maintain my offer Dj Happy is best for this event , the most famous , popular and known worldwide , and this may also be of interest to the Russians.   I agree that we need to think long term but Art.inc is who has brought more money and if you put the other company, in my opinion would generate a conflict and can withdraw their great contribution . Best regards.
Dear Alex, Thank you for your answer. Iï¿½m a little bit confused now regarding the catering since you proposed an international three course meal in your first offer. In this offer you are suggesting an international buffet. I think the catering is one of the most important points to be considered in the event plan. Moreover, as you know for sure, a celebrating dinner brings the people together and a pleasant atmosphere promotes making new business contacts. You are totally right that on this event also lots of guest from other nationalities will take part. However, in my opinion we should appreciate our new members from Russia and we could show that we are open for their culture with an excellent local Russian cuisine. Furthermore, this culinary delight would be also a new experience for our members from other countries. Please, explain me in more detail your opinion on this important issue. Regarding the music at, I can totally understand your opinion about DJ Happy. The music act should of course be excellent. However, it should accompany the event and not be the most important act. I once more want to emphasize that we should show that we are interested in the Russian culture. Therefore, I kindly want to ask you which arguments do you have against the local Russian band? I am aware of the fact that Art Inc. offered more money for the sponsoring of this event. However, as I already wrote in my first mail, I really think that we should consider the long term offer from Boomerang. Such a contract would be beneficial for the ISA organization in terms of long term thinking. Furthermore, with this suggestion we both could show that for us a sustainability event planning and long term thinking regarding the future development of ISA is important. What is our opinion on this suggestion? Best regards, Chris
good afternoon: I read your suggestions, now I expose my arguments:  If now I suggest an international buffet, and you want all Russian and not everything can be logically so. So now I think the best option would be an international buffet where everyone can eat and enjoy different food because the Russian is very heavy. I have nothing against Russian local band, but still insist that DJ HAPPY is best for this event. Not everyone is Russian and it is also international act, Dj is best for this occasion, is famous and known worldwide. While a Russian band is only for Russian people and you have to think also in the rest of people who will attend the event. The important thing in my opinion is ma choose the Sponsor, still defend the idea that we must choose Art.ini since they are the ones who have made more money and so is a way to thank him. Boomerang is a good long-term option but you must think in this day and they will be present. In the end you will present the act and that is a point in favour for you, consider my arguments and above all choose the Sponsor.
"Dear Alex, Many thanks for explaining your point of view and your detailed answers regarding my questions. As I understood (and please feel free to correct me if I am wrong), the buffet is a very important point for you. I like your argument that you also want to appreciate the other nationalities. Thus, I have the following suggestion: Since ISA is an international organization and we as organizers want to show our appreciation to all nationalities we may agree on an international dinner. However, we have to consider that this event is a very special one and should be celebrating and promoting the exchange of the different members. Thus, my suggestion would be to come back to your first offer which was the three course meal. Concerning the music act, I am really happy that you have nothing against a local Russian band. I want to emphasize ones more that this would be a great opportunity to appreciate our new members and introduce our other international members to a new culture. I really hope that you understand my point of view as I did concerning the dinner. In my opinion for the dinner and music act, the proposed solution would be the middle course of our both understanding regarding ISAï¿½s interests for the event planning. Since we are both together trying to suggest an excellent proposal for this event, I really hope that we can settle these two points The last open point we have to discuss is the sponsoring. Here, I still donï¿½t get your arguments concerning the art.inc. This company provides more money for this single event ï¿½ in this point I totally agree with you. However, ISA is not only a single event; it is an organization which is successful already for many years and also wants to be so in the future. Therefore, the choice of boomerang is for certain also the interest for the heads of ISA. Please, explain me in detail your opinion regarding the advantages of a higher single sponsoring from art.inc. Many thanks in advance! Hoping to hear from you soon and best regards, Chris"
Good morning: Thank you for your arguments and points of view. I explain that my view remains the same as you explained and argued all your questions and wishes. I see that do not reach any conclusion and negotiation must end today. So here I propose to let me choose the Sponsor and the buffet because to me these are the most important points , and all for international people, you should think more about all the people who attend the event and not only the Russian people . While their arguments seem to me but I still think that Art. Inc buffet and are best for this event. You already presented the act and can choose the music. so we both have things we came for and winning is what we want. I hope your answer. Best regards. Alex.
Iï¿½m really thankful for your proposed suggestions. You are totally right that we have to finish our negotiations today and want to find a good solution to take part at the contest. My suggestions for the three remaining points are the following: Band: Local Russian Band According to the sponsoring I would only agree on Art.Inc if we take the international three course menu (once more reminding you that was also your first offer). Best regards, Chris
    Sorry but I am disagree . You want everything and this can not be. I prefer the buffet and the sponsor of Art.inc . In the music would agree . You will present the gala as well as we had agreed . Best regards.
Dear Alex, My first offer was the national Russian menu. Your arguments for an international dinner were very good and therefore I agree on the international meal. However, I really hope that we can find a compromise between the buffet and a traditional Russian meal. This would be in my opinion the three course international meal. Furthermore I once more want to point out the advantages of a three course meal in more detail: -         A served dinner is more glamorous   -         We can choose more delight food (considering ï¿½class instead of massï¿½)   -         You can better get in contact with the other persons at the event. For example: The communication is not interrupted if a person wants to get food from the buffet. Additionally if we are taking a buffet, a person might not return to the table if he/she meets another person to talk with at the buffet and therefore the communication at the table might be interrupted.  ï¿½ Promote networking I hope that I have given you now enough arguments for this choise. Best regards, Chris
    I already have argued my reasons , and I still think the best buffet series , and that this would not disrupt the dinner since so other people could relate to and know . If you just put three Russian dishes people do not get up from their tables to discuss and create another type of environment , the Russian food is very heavy and not everyone likes . People coming is international and you are not having any account . This is my point of view.   Best regards.
Dear Alex, Thank you for the negotiation. I agree on your offer since we have to find an agreement to participate in the contest. However, I still want to express my opinion on your way of argumentation because if we will the contest we will have to work together. In my opinion I wrote my arguments very clearly. We never discussed a three course meal of Russian cuisine, but an international one. Since you were bringing up the topic of a three course Russian meal, I have to conclude that you did not read my arguments carefully. Thus, for our further cooperation I hope that our correspondence will be improved from both sides. All the best, Chris
Hey Chris, it seems that we both has to build a team for the competition. Thus we don't know each other I hope that it will work out. First of all some information to me. I'm  a member of ISA since 2009.  I've organised some smaller events before, so  I've already some experiences in organizing projects. For sure you know the importance of this new opening of the subsiary and 40th anniversary of the ISA. I guess it's also in your interest to win this competition. For the organisation are still some issues to discuss. For example the design of the catering. My suggestion would be to have a easy-going atmosphere, therefore it would be nice to have an international buffet. Everyone is free choose between different food.  Moreover I think it would be nice to have a more modern music act to attract more young talents. I would suggest DJ Happy, as you know he is a super famous musician.  The next point I want to discuss is the sponsor selection. In my opinionen I would prefer Art Inc. as sponsor because we've a long relationship to it and it's hard to find good sponsor for such a longtime. What's your opionion? Let's rock the competition. I look forward to a good cooperation with you. Yours Chris  
Hi Alex! Thanks for  reaching out, I look forward to working with you. Regarding the sponsor, I understand that Boomerang is offering slightly less than Art Inc., but are willing to sign a long-term sponsorship contract. Under these circumstances I think they are the better offer, unless you have certain information on why we should take Art Inc. instead? As to the overall atomsphere, I really think we should show more appreciation to the new host and honor local food and music. The program does not involve anything Russian otherwise, which is not really nice. Having worked with Russian businesses before, I think they would really appreciate that. What do you think? Best, Chris.
Hey Chris, well I see your points but I think it would suit better to your vision of a international organisation to offer international food. We could stress your multicultural attitude and also show upcoming students the possibilities of working for international enterprises. Furthermore it's not only the opening of a new office, it's even more our 40th anniversary. So it should be more openminded to other countries. Not only because we're presented in 20 different countries, it would also underline ISA's succes to gain such an influence all over the world. I can see that we also have to attire Russian enterprises but we shouldn't forget to stay to your characteristics which defines our big range to reach young talents. To find a compromise I would agree to take a local music act. I guess it would adress an international audience. Moreover it appreciates the new opening of the office. I thought of Art Inc. as sponsor because we worked with them for a long time and we would probably destroy this relationship when we take Boomerang as sponsor because it's a competitor of Art Inc. I see that Boomerang maybe seems to be a better option coz of the longterm contract. But I don't think that Art Inc. won't support us in the future if we dont give them a reason. What do you think about my arguments? Yours Alex  
Hi, Looks like we are very close to an agreement! You raise good points but the entire rest of the program is already international with no Russian influence. You may recall that the previous attempt for ISA to set up an office in Moscow in 2004 failed because of problems in the preparation - I'm very concerned that we may be repeating the same mistake again. I really think that local Russian food is a simple yet effective tribute to our newest member and to the Russian businesses that we are trying to attract. In exchange for this, I offer you the opportunity - if you want - to hold the opnening speech. As you may know, I am seeking for permanent employment at ISA and would love such an opportunity for myself, but our overall success as a team for this event is more important to me than to hold the opening speech. I hope you are equally eager to make this event a success! Best, Chris.
"Hey Chris, I think we're almost close to an agreement but there are still points to discuss. I was pretty close to accept your last suggestion, but I couldn't imagine to have only Russian food. Thanks for offering me the the opening speech. It's really kind of you, but I already accepted to a local band even I don't think it will attracts our young talents and I accepted to Boomerang even it will only supports us with less money. Furthermore it will has the consequence that we lose our ancestor sponsor Art Inc who was a reliable sponsor before. Yes it's also in my interest to make this event successful and I don't want to make the same mistakes again but I think in the catering issue I can't agree with you.  I think it's better to have an international buffet. As I told you before it's a more easy-going atmosphere and ""international"" doesn't mean that there is only one sort of food. I mean we could also offer some special Russian food there. This solution would meet everyone's needs and preferences. Moreover an international buffet allows people better to network because you can walk around and talk to others. I hope we come to an agreement for everyone's sake and the winning performance;-) Yours Alex"
Hi Alex, Yes, I agree we are very close to finalizing the deal. I think we can find compromise on all open issues. I'm not sure why you are raising the sponorship issue again. As said, Boomerang is offering a long-term contract which is beneficial for ISA thus for both of us. Let me know if you have contrary information and I am happy to reopen this point again for discussion as needed. Regarding the food, I think that buffet is really inappropriate for the high level important people that we expect. According to my information it is a decline in quality and service from the previous years, which is not really good for our event. Would you agree to at least a 3-course menu? We have the necessary budget and it would make a better impression than a buffet. As to presentation, I don't think that sharing is a good idea - we would need to practice so much to get it right, and it never works with passing around microphones and such. I suggest that either you do the opening speech and I do the awards ceremony, or the other way around. As said, I would *really* love to do the opening speech if you do not want to do it, but am happy for you to do it as well. I'm not being generous here, I just think it is better quality than sharing. Best, Chris
Hey Chris, thanks for your fast reply. Under this aspect I would say we choose the 3-course menu. I didn't know that there was  a decline in quality and service previous year.  If it's okay I would love to do the speech. If not I can live with doing the awards.  Sharing would be probably fairer but you are right, it's more effort to practice it. What do you think? Thank you for accommodating. yours Alex
Hi Alex, Well, if you're indifferent then I would really appreciate doing the opening speech. As said, I'm striving for permanent employment at ISA and this would be a great opportunity. It seems that you won't move your position on the catering anymore, so I guess this is a good compromise. In case you accept the offer then thanks a lot and all the best, it was great working with you! Regards, Chris
Hey Chris, thanks for working together. Hopefully we will win with this concept :) All the best for you. yours Alex
Hello Chris, How are you? First of all I want to thank you for our already settled issues for the conference. I think if we go on like this we have a real chance to win the competition. I am really looking forward to organize the conference in real together with you. I believe our conference would be a relaxing and lovely evening for our guests, no matter if they are high ISA members, local business people or us, the students. Therefore, I have some suggestions we still have to talk about: One open issue is the Music Act: In my opinion it would be great to have DJ Happy (Music Act: DJ Happy).  As the music acts form the last years have not been that good. Therefore, I suggest him, as he is both a professional and a really famous musician, he knows what our evening at the conference needs. What do you think? Another point is the catering, I suggest a buffet. The advantage is that everybody is able to find something they like. If we arrange it as an international buffet every guest has also the possibility to discover new meals (Catering: International buffet).   Also the exact date of the conference is not yet fixed. The CEO of ISA gave us the timeframe of five weeks in December. In order to avoid a collision with another conference that takes place, I propose the third week in December (Date of Conference: Week 3) . Another great act of the evening is the announcement of the yearï¿½s award winners, which are several ISA members that have made a big impact for the ISA organization in the past and the other act is the opening speech. For the announcement of the awards I propose you and I would really looking forward to do the opening speech ( Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris). Last thing we have to organize is the sponsor selection. As the Art Inc. had the best offer as a short term payment directly for the event I would engage them as our sponsor (Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.). What is your opinion? I look forward to hear from you soon. Best regards, Alex  
"Dear Alex, thanks for your information and your really nice e-mail. Im also looking forward to to plan a good event. And I think if we do good we will win the competition. Never the less, i can't agree on your opening offer due to some reasons, but I'm sure we can handle the issues and meet at the best possible solution for both. First the music act. As I know DJ Happy is a famous internattional music star and i think thqat it might be really interesting for the younger generation,  my concern is first, that DJ Happy will overshadow the reputation of the ISA and distract attention from the event towards the music act.  Personally my vision for the event is that we should show interest in the russian culture and therefor we should have a local russian band as the music act.  Please let it go through your mind and send me your answer. (Music Act: Local Russian band  ) Second the catering, As mentioned i think that local russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. My opinion is, that since we are expecting many important people to be there wo expect a certain level of formality. Therefor i recommend a local russian cousine. (Catering: local Russian cuisine) I agree on your third week for the date conference. So let us fix this ;-) (Date of Conference: Week 3)  Well point four is going to be the more difficult one i think. We both know that the speech is highly more prestigious and more important than the awards announcement. (CV issues etc..) And since there is a high coordination effort of doing half-half my opinion is that this is a winner takes it all issue and there should be discussed later on. Of course i don't know how important the speech is for you and therefor in this counteroffer i will change the speech-awards roles and wait for your answer. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Last thing sponsor selection Art Inc made the best offer and to be honest, they are my second best option. But with a highly difference. to the frist one. This is due to the fact, that boomerang made also a very good offer, of course not that much money, but they said that they would be willing to sign a long-term contract. This would ensure some financial security and in the long run im totally sure, that this long term contract with boomerang would be a really good deal for the ISA and a highly prestigious deal, if we can get them to be our sponsors. By the way. To build some trust to each other aswell as doing a more transperent negotiation I can tell you that the sponsor issue has the most imporatance for me.And i Really would be happy if we take boomerang. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Sincerely Chris      "
Dear Sirs, Here is my offer about how the conference for the 40th anniversary of ISA shoul be organized. I hope it will be appreciated and if you think that something should be changed, donï¿½t hesitate to contact me. Best Regards Alex
Dear Alex, nice to hearing from you. I hope you're Ok? Thank you for your offer, I appreciate that but I would like to suggest some minor changes: Concerning the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  you have taken a good choice. I also agree, that Boomerang is a good sponsoring partner, as they offer a long-term contract with the assurance of future events. I am not so happy with the proposed Music Act: Local Russian band. As FreeLife is a pop band it primarily attracts the younger generation, but I think the strategy of the event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with local companies and officials. So I'd rather prefer a local Russian band. To run a common thread through the conference a local Russian cuisine would better fit the uniform overall picture. You proposed the first week for the Date of Conference.. Unfortunately the International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow is taking place in the exact same week, so I would suggest the third Week, as it does not collide with such an important event. I totally agree that we should share the Presentation Tasks. The opening speech is very prestigious and has a high impact on the future perspectives in ISA.  Simply announcing the winner of the award is less attractive, but as a matter of good will I think I will give in and let you do the speech. I hope you agree with me but please contact me if there are any problems. Kind regards, Chris
  Dear Chris,   I really thank you for having expressed your comments and opinions about my offer in your reply.   I read with pleasure that you agree in choosing Boomerang as sponsorship partner as well as considering it a good partner according to a long term view.   Moreover I am also glad to see that you agree on how sharing the presentations tasks. I thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to have the opening speech and I hope that delivering the awards to the winners will be a good experience for you too.   Besides that, I think we should discuss a bit more about the music act and the catering. I understand that you want to give the event local features but since the ISA conference is an international event are so people from all the world are expected to come, I think we should make the atmosphere international too. For this reason I think we should choose an international buffet so that we are sure that it will satisfy everybodyï¿½s tastes. On the other hand, I agree with you on choosing a Local Russian Band cause I think it would be nice to have something that reminds the local culture too.   To conclude, for what concerns the date of the conference, I agree with you in organizing it during the 3rd week cause the essential thing for me is organizing it before Christmas as afterwards people will not have the time to come to the conference.   I hope you will appreciate my counteroffer and if you still disagree on some points let me know.   Kind Regards,   Alex  
Dear Alex, thank you for your quick response and pointing out your concerns to me. First, I want to mention, that I am very happy with our decision on the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang I also read with pleasure, that you agreed on Week 3 for the Date of Conference Regards to the Presentation Tasks  I want to wish you good luck for preparing your speech and I hope we will cooperate well. Furthermore I am grateful for your willingness in agreeing on a Local Russian band. Concerning the CateringI understand your matter about the internationality of the event. However, I think that everything less than a three course meal would be a decline with regards to the conferences in the last few years, which werenï¿½t some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversary. Maybe we can agree on an International three course meal? Looking forward to hearing from you. Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I am really happy to see that we agree on almost all points regarding the organization of the confernce! I understand your reasons for preferring the international three course meal but I still believe that we would have better to choose the International buffet. I think that the confernce should have an atmosphere that promotes networking and getting to know new people, things that are consistent with the ISA basis values themselves and the ISA members (young students). For this reason, I donï¿½t think that organizing an International buffet would be a decline regarding to the last conferenceï¿½s trend, but it could be seen as a positive and modern change since the international course meal is something very formal and a bit outdated too. I hope you understand my explanation and that we can maybe agree on it! Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Kind Regards Alex
Dear Alex, I am also grateful that we agree on most of the negotiation issues. Concerning the catering, I can see your point. You are totally right, that ISA is run by young people. What you may have forgotten is that the celebration will attract many important public figures and business people whose attendance will help ISA to establish itself as a legitimate organisation in Russia. Therefore, the conference will be attended primarily by business partners, sponsors and is mainly done for publicity. However, the 40th anniversary adds a great deal to the credibility of the organisation as it proves longevity and success of the business model. An informal buffet would harm the prestige of the ISA. Having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. Hopefully you can understand my concerncs, as the catering is one of the most important issues to me. Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I understnad your point, the things you said are right. But I still keep on thinking that the main aim of the event is to is to involve and attract young people and so choosing the Interantional buffet would be the best choice because it would give them more chances to talk with the important public and business people that you mentioned in you reply too. I belive that this could be very a important oppotuinity for their working future.   I am so firmly convinced of this that I am willing to let you held the opening speech of the conference in exhange. I hope that you evaluate this offer and that we can find an agreement. Kind Regards Alex 
Dear Alex, I read your counteroffer with pleasure. I appreciate it and want to thank you for your cooperation. I hope that the result of the negotiation is mutually profitable. Kind regards, Chris
Hello Chris, It's my great pleasure to organize such an important conference with you. As a team member, I am expecting proper co-operation & co-ordination from you & I think you're expecting such from me as well. I will try my level best to assist you appropriately in order to make such an impotant event fruitful. For this conference, I've already planned some aspects like catering, events, presentation,  sponsors selection & most importantly appropriate date for this conference. I hope you will consider & appraise my offers prudently & give your feedback as early as possible. I'm eagerly waiting for your response. With regard, Alex
Hi Alex! It's my pleasure to work on this project with you as well. I look forward to our cooperation and I am confident we can achieve our goals and plan a great and productive event. I am delighted that you have put so much thought and consideration into your offer. I especially agree with you with on the date of the conference. I also think the third week is the best for the event. There are , however, some points that can be further discussed.  Firstly, I believe since this event is organized on such a formal manner, and we are trying to have a great first impression on our russian counterparts, it would be best for the event to have local Russian cuisine instead of international buffet. Aslo, as the theme of the event goes, I believe that our local Russian band would be perfect for the overall mood of the ceremony. I have reviewed their work and they seem to be a perfect match for us and the event. As you might have guessed, I am quite familiar with the Russian culture and atmosphere. Actually, I have been participating in some Russian language courses, and I am rather fluent in the language. So I was thinking maybe I can start with the speech, do it both in English and Russian so that all the guests feel included and then you can go ahead with the awards anouncements. Last but not least, sposnsor selection. Boomerang has for a rather long time been sponsering our events and they are willing to give us a great contract that would guarantee a long-term sponsorship. I think it would have a great impression on the members of the jurry for the competition to see that we have come up with such a great contract. I look forward to your views on these matters. Please do not hesitate to ask me any questions that you might have in mind!   Best Regards  Chris
Hello Chris, I' really appreciating your offers but unfortunately, I can't able to accept all of your choices. I'm complying with you in case of sponsor selection but regarding catering, musical act & presentation tasks I think you should again consider my offers. From my point of view, most of the important guests will come from different countries, so intrnational buffet is a good option, by choosing this option the guests can enjoy the events environment by roaming everywhere rather than sitting only at one place. As you know many imporatant personalities before,it will be better if you will providing the awards & if you are not sure about the availabilty of Dj Happy then Free life is another good option for us. I definitely hope that, you will rethink my offers. with regards  Alex
Dear Alex, Hope you're doing well. I read your last email and  I understand your point of view on some of the suggestions, I think FreeLife can also be a good option. So let's keep that as our music act. However, the catering still is not quite what I have in mind. As you have been to previous annual events of the ISA, you must also be familiar with the formality of these events. Since this is the 40th anniversary of the organization and many importantfigures are attending the event, the catering calls for something more formal than a buffet. If you are not sure about the local Russian cuisine, then the next best suggestion would be international three course meal, I believe. That seems to be the logical choice, so that while all international guests enjoy the meals, the formality of the event stays intact as well. Since we are such a great team, and I think we have done great so far(!), I think we can manage the presentation task as you said. I do hope you like my suggestions and I look forward to your response.   Br, Chris   
Hello Chris, I'm really very glad to organize such an important event with you because so far you're very understandable & think rationally about my each & every offer. We've almost same assent regarding issues except catering. I was thinking a lot regarding this but still my choice stuck with International Buffet, the reason behind it I want to do some thing different & innovative which will not be like as usual ISA party. I attended several ISA parties before & honestly speaking I found most of the time boring catering & last time I asked some of the guests regarding catering, most of them said it would be better if the atmosphere was much more relaxing & easy-going, not just sitting & so formal. From this point of view I thought it will be better if we do little bit different not traditional at our event. I completely respect your point of view, but I also hope that you will appreciate this & alter your decision about it. I'm eagerly waiting for your response. Alex
Hi Alex! I am also really excited about the prospect of being able to plan such a prestigious event, I am quite happy with how everything has turned out so far. I absolutly believe we can win this competition and organize a great party for everyone involved. I know everyhting we have decided so far are best for the event. I've been going back and forth on the catering. However way I think about it, I just can't see such an important event with a buffet(!!!!!). The thing is, there are a lot of managers and top executives participating in the event, and I strongly think a buffet is less than satisfactory for that atmosphere. Formal events such as this call for formal dining, I believe. Here I have again included my offer. I hope you can rethink this last point, because in all honesty this is quite important to me. truely yours, Chris
Hi Chris, Actually still I feel buffet is better option. On the other hand, I got your point of view as well. You don't want to take any risk & need something more formal. I thought a lot about this matter & finally decide I Should stand with your this choice. We need each other co-operation each & every moment to make our event successful. I also believe through our hard work & motivation we will definitely organize successful event. Thanks for your co-operation so far.  Before this event if you will have any doubt regarding all of these issues feel free to write me without hesitation. I wish you good luck. We will meet each other very soon in Saint Petersburg. With Regard, Alex 
Dear Chris,   We agreed on certain points for organizing the 40th anniversary of ISA but there are still some points that we have to discuss. You will find enclosed my offer about the sponsors, the music act, the presentation tasks, the catering and the date. Feel free to ask me some questions. I am really looking forward to work with you and I am sure it can be successfull.   Sincerely, Alex
Dear Alex, I am happy to get an insight on your ideas how we could organize the 40th anniversary of ISA. In addition to my message, you will recieve my counteroffer. As you can see, we already agreed on the Date of the Conference Date of Conference: Week 3   However, there are many open points which are not according to my plan. Nevertheless, I am sure we will find an ideal tradeoff between our preferences concerning this important event. Please feel free to ask me some questiones as well. With kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, Thank you for your answer. I am glad that we agreed on the date, which is a good point, showing that we advance together. However, it seems that you would like to make our guests discover a lot the local things. This is good but I have some experience in planning events and the local russian band might not be the best to attract the more guests that we can. Atmosphere is really important and I think you want as much as me the best for this anniversary. I have some contacts of two very good international bands. This can be the opportunity to attract more people for our event since those bands are very famous. In return, you will see that I considered your proposal for the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Let me know your mind, Kind regards, Your partner, Alex
Dear Alex, Thank you for your second offer. To attract as much people as possible to this special event is one of our big targets. As you said, it is also necessary to provide a good atmosphere and since we have invited very important guests, it is expected to serve a proper dinner. In addition, the guests of this special aniversary deserve a special treatment. Therefore, I would decide to take  Catering: local Russian cuisine  so that the loss of the local music act is not conspicuous. Showing our respect to the russian culture has high priority because the decision of a new branch office is dependend on the conclusion of this event. As you can see in my new offer I considered your last message and, in return, I would consider your wish to the presentation tasks Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  . Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, Thank you for this new offer which is very interesting. But one point let me perplex still... As you said, we should serve to our guests a proper dinner. What would you think about an international three course meal? That could be the insurance that they would feel well treated. In this free course meal we could serve a starter or a russian desert ? I am not sure that all the guests will like a hole russian dinner. Otherwise it sounds that we agree and that we made a good working team ! Best wishes Alex
Dear Alex, In my opinion it is very important that we have at least one aspect of this event focussed on the local culture. I considered your wish to have a famous international music act at the conference,  therefore I would stay with Catering: local Russian cuisine  . I fear that a desert alone would not be adequate for our guests. Furthermore, I gave you your preferred  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   . As you did not mention it in your last message, I suppose it is not the most important point on your list. In my new offer I suggested to change the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  and the Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  . Please let me know if this fits more to you. This offer would consider two preferences of your plan and two of mine as we agreed on the Date of Conference: Week 3  . I think that this is a fair offer and should satisfy both of us. Best wishes, Chris
Dear Chris, I think yes Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  is a good choice since they have been our partner for a long time. Organize an innovative event doesn't mean to break the relationship with ISA's partners. As Catering: local Russian cuisine  seems really important for you and because I trust your professional skills, I will accept this. I appreciate the fact that you tried to satisfy both of our wishes and yes, this is a fair offer that, I hope, will satisfy as many guests and judges as possible. It was a pleasure to negotiate with you, Sincerely, Alex
Hello Chris, I hope you do well since our last encounter. As for my part, I am doing well :) Last time, we already settled some organisational issues but there are still some agenda points unsettled. I think we should start by clarifying the basic questions ï¿½whoï¿½ and ï¿½whenï¿½. More precisely, ï¿½Sponsor Selectionï¿½ and ï¿½Date of Conferenceï¿½: Sponsor Selection: As you know, Art Inc. made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event. Boomerang also made a very good offer, but offered slightly less money for the event. However, Art Inc. should be considered as the best option when making this decision. They have supported the ISA for a long time and therefore I am sure that their support will continue in the future ï¿½ unless they change their mind. Selecting Boomerang ï¿½ a direct competitor of Art Inc. ï¿½ could be such a reason and consequently I am definitely preferring Art Inc. over Boomerang and especially over the other two offers which are even lower.   Date of Conference: The CEO of ISA gave us a timeframe of five weeks during which the conference has to take place, however some dates are conflicting with other events or situations which have to be taken into consideration: Week 1:  The International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow, one of the biggest business conferences in Russia, takes place at week 1. Week 2: Some of ISAï¿½s higher ranked members ï¿½ among others, the organisationï¿½s vice presidentï¿½ are unavailable and therefore would not be able to join the event.  Week 4: Since the event is going to take place in December, I would say it would be more considerate of us to have the event in the first half of the month. Week 4 would be very close to the Christmas holidays. I know we are an International Organisation but most of our members, offices and partners are within Europe and hence we should respect Christian holidays.  Week 5: This week would be right around Christmas and consequently I believe that this time slot is definitely the worst option. If we use the method of elimination, only week 3 remains which should be the most suited time when taking everything into consideration. Since impartially, these are the best solutions for both of us, I believe that you will agree with me concerning the issue ï¿½Sponsor Selectionï¿½ and ï¿½Date of Conferenceï¿½. Hence, you can choose our next issue(s) to talk about.   Best Regards, Alex.
Hello Alex, Nice that you are doing well. I am fine, thanks! Like you suggested I would also like to clarify the basic questions first: Date of conference: First of all I fully agree with you on the date. We should hold the conference in the third week, seeing as it is the best solution as you said.   Sponsor Selection: You are right that Art Inc. made a good payment offer. But you have to consider that they only offered a short-term payment for the event. We also have to think about ISA's financial security in the long run. I know that Art Inc. always donated some money for different events but without a written contract they can always change their mind (which you mentioned yourself). Boomerang on the other hand are willing to sign a long-term contract in which they would ensure the sponsoring of future ISA events and they also made a very good offer for the upcoming event. I think that the safety of ISA's financial perspective in the future is far more valuable than a few extra coins for one conference. Thus I am convinced that Boomerang is the right choice for us. I hope that you see my point and can agree with me.   Catering: Since I think that the sponsor issue will be resolved quickly, I'll already continue with the next topic: catering. As you know, this year's conference will be important as we are celebrating ISA's 40th anniversary, along with the establishment of the new subsidiary in Saint Petersburg. This will be an opportunity to get in touch with Russian companies in order to win them over for the partner network. In this case it's only logical to have local Russian cuisine as catering to show appreciation and respect to our new Russian members and guests. Either way, we should serve a real menu and not some kind of buffet, because I expect many important people to be present who expect a certain level of formality. I think that you will feel the same about this issue. I am looking forward to your reply. Best Regards, Chris
Hi Chris, At first I apologize for answering a little bit late. I actually wanted to answer you this morning but I had to take an exam and afterwards I had to work. Now back to our topic: Sponsor Selection: It is a short-time payment from Art Inc. and I mentioned it first because it has always been a short-time payment. It is like a tacit consent. They have always supported the ISA even without a mandatory agreement. Hence, over the years ISA and Art Inc. became good partners and I believe we cannot afford to lose a long lasting partner. In the end, Art Inc. will pay as long as Boomerang because it has always been this way and we will be able to keep an old partner by accepting their offer. Catering: I understand your point of view but there is something real important missing: ISA is a MULITNATIONAL organisation which is only so successful because of its NETWORKING and ACQUAINTANCES which requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. Consequently, having a very formal three course meal where everybody sits down for several hours with the same people goes completely against that idea. In almost the same manner, it would be disadvantageous just having a national buffet, precisely just having a local Russian cuisine. It would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like :) If you accept these conditions, I would be willing to accept a local russian band as a compromise which is your preference I think  :) I will check the Negoisst System twice a day. Have a nice evening and best regards Alex
Hi Alex, No problem, everyone is busy from time to time. :) Regarding our discussion: Sponsor Selection: As I mentioned before, I think it's more valuable and also important to have a written contract in this case. You see, I get your point that Art Inc. has been a good sponsor so far and that they supported us. Had they offered us an actual long-term contract as well, then it would only be natural to select them as our sponsor - nothing to argue about here. But the fact is that they didn't. A tacit consent is nice, but it doesn't provide any security for the future. To be honest, I don't think that Art Inc. would abandon us without any reason, but we don't know what might happen in the future. Maybe they won't be able to afford the sponsoring of ISA anymore or a change in management could also change their intentions. Those are only two examples of situations that we definately have to consider and that are also not unlikely to happen in the long run. It's just another factor of uncertainty, which we could easily prevent with a written long-term contract by selecting Boomerang as our sponsor. Catering: I would still prefer to have a local Russian cuisine, but I understand your point about the internationality of the event. Though I still think that we should offer an actual three course meal, because anything less than that would actually be a decline from the conferences over the last few years. You also have to consider that those weren't even some special events - this year we are celebrating ISA's 40th anniversary (along with welcoming our new Russian members). That is why I am willing to accept an international three course meal instead of local Russian cuisine. In my opinion, a three course meal does not conflict with a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere.   You are right that a local Russian band is my preference for the music choice, because of similar reasons as the catering selection. I think it's fair to have an international meal and in return a local Russian band. I hope you agree with me. Once again, I am interested in your opinion on these issues and I am looking forward to your answer. Once we have agreed on these points, I suggest that we move on to the last topic: the presentation tasks.   Best Regards, Chris
"Hi Chris, I am willing to accept your offer concerning the sponsor selection since it seems very important to you. But I have to ask in return for your agreement concernin the Catering, precisely International Buffet.  Additionally, I am willing to give you a vote of confidence and share ""private information"" which will be very interesting for you: I know Andy, who is Dr. Illenschitzï¿½ assistant. I met Andy at an ISA Christmas party a few years ago and since then we have kept in touch. I contacted him regarding the competition: He told me that the first selection criteria is the team performance. The second criteria for the job selection is the individual negotiator performance within the winning team. Consequently, working together with will increase the chances of getting the best team concept :) For the sake of our team performance and for the sake of the anniversary, I am willing to give you the chance of holding the speech. The opening speech is very prestigious and you would have the possibility to address many important aspects of the future development of ISA. Having such an important part in the conference would have a high impact on your future perspectives in ISA and the speech additionally would look quite good on your CV. In contrast, simply announcing the winner of the yearly ISA award and handing out the certificate to the respective person is clearly less attractive. Again, I just want the international buffet since I really believe it is the best solution (as I explained in my last message). I'm looking forward to your reply. Best Regards, Alex"
Hello Alex, First of all thank you for sharing your insider information, I really appreciate it. I also have a business contact who told me the same about the selection criteria - first team performance, then individual performance. Unfortunately, my contact doesn't know whether only one or two jobs will be offered to the best performing team. Either way, I accept your offer. You know what I think about the catering selection. But since you made a concession regarding the sponsor selection and also offered me the chance of holding the speech, I am willing to accept an international buffet. Thank you for your cooperation! Have a nice day! Best Regards, Chris
Hello!According to our task we have to set some arrangements considering upcoming ISA conference. Below I send my ideas. I think that we should be more opened for new students, especially more dynamic and therefore I suggest for Music Act: DJ Happy  . He is very dynamic and may attract many guests. Regarding Catering: International buffet  I suggest so because not everybody may know or like Russian cuisine. It is safer to not have any unpleasant situations. Regarding Date of Conference: Week 3  I propose the third week. In the other weeks there are another events which are in some way competing to our conference. Regarding Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  . I think it will be better to divide opening activities between two of us. And the last but not least - Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  They can offer us more money than other sponsors so I think it is the best choice. I hope that you will agree with me when it comes to this ideas. I am waiting for your response. Regards, Alex
Hi Alex, Just got your message. How was your weekend? Thank you for sharing your thoughts! I'll thoroughly go through it and get back to you with my ideas on our open points in the course of this day. Have a nice day, Chris
Hi Chris, thank you for your answer. My weekend was OK, thank you. And yours? I cannot wait for your answer to my offer. I hope we reach a conclusion good for both of us. Regards, Alex  
Dear Alex, Great to read enthusiastic your reply! Thank you, my weekend was kind of busy but also nice. A team effort that is good for both of us seems also desirable for me and I'm sure we'll make it to a decent agreement. Please find my thoughts on your proposal below: There are two general questions I'd like to ask you. What is your experience with event organisation of this size. What do you consider as the target audience for the event? Clearly defining the latter may help us shape things to the best fitting proposal. Which role do you see for the music act in relation to ISA as such, as well as to the event? I also think that it is important to meet the expectations of the participants. As for the catering, do you have any negative experience with Russian cuisine? What do you think about highlighting the aspect of an event in Russia by showing local cuisine in order to demonstrate local culture? Regarding the conference date I think that's wise choice of yours. Let's fix this point! As for the presentation, splitting also seems good to me. Do you see any preference on who takes over which part? Art Inc. as a sponsor would provide the biggest short term gains, that's right. One aspect I would like to highlight in this respect is the long-term perspective. Therefore, did you consider the long-term partnership that Boomerang offer? We should maybe also add this aspect in our considerations. I'm looking forward to reading your reply on my thoughts and to get a step closer to our goal! Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, thank you for your interest in our task. With a pleasure I am going to answer to your questions. I have an experience in planning and organising events. Maybe they were a bit smaller but they were very successful. Moreover as a target I consider talented students because when we will have a contact to such people our business partners will be more eager to cooperate with us. I propose music act because it is a very good way to reach young people. Therefore there should be a famous artist to attract many of them to be able choose from them the best talented people. I think that not everybody is familiar with Russian cuisine and can like it. It is not safe to serve meals to which people may be not used to. So the date of conference is fixed - Date of Conference: Week 3  . Wonderful! When it comes to the presentation - as I wrote before I suggest Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris . Would be it OK for you? I considered the long-term partnership of Boomerang. But Art Inc. has supported us for a long time and it is very probable that this will not change. I think I made clearer my point of view. And what do you think about the issues above? Regards, Alex
Hi Alex, Thank you for your answer! I suggest we go on clarifying our ideas of every point and hopefully soon get to common ground. That's why I stick to sorting out all question instead of simply playing offer-ping-pong. I am sure you get my point. Did you know that the conference is set to celebrate ISA's 40th anniversary? Which is why there may be mostly business people attending the event. I consider this a very important aspect regarding the overall setting. Students are attracted by ISA in any case. But for business people there are certain protocols to be taken into account. Such as a certain level of formality or protocol and also presentation of the hosting country. This aspect may well get even more importance, as Russia will be more than hosting the event, but be the location of the new subsidiary. For these reasons I rather propose Russian cuisine and a formal menu, as well as the local Russian band. There is also another danger that I see. DJ Happy being pretty famous might take off attention of ISA. Don't you think we should highlight ISA and have a the overall programm support that instead of the other way round? As for the sponsoring, I agree that there is a substantial base with Art Inc. Still, I have a feeling that long-term perspective should be kept in mind. Especially as Russia is very different to western markets. So, I propose we should consider this risk. As for the ceremony, openly speaking the opening speech is very prestigious, so that would be laurels for you. However, I am willing to compromise for the sake of an overall best possible proposal. So, please think about my inputs and let me know if you maybe agree with some of the insights that I provided you with. Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, thank you for your clarification of your standpoint. I know that the conference is set to celebrate ISA's 40th anniversary. But in my opinion we should also think about attracting young people. However, I can agree with you about local Russian band to emphasise that the event will take place in Russia. On the other hand it is really risky to serve only Russian cuisine. What do you think what can happen when some important guest from another part of world will not able to eat anything because he or she does not like Russian cuisine? It is really safer to serve international buffet - then everybody can find something for him or her without such a risk. When it comes to the sponsoring I still think that Art Inc. is the best option because we cooperate with them for a very long time. I think that they will not change their mind if we will not find any competitor to them to support us. Moreover, as you wrote already we celebrate 40th anniversary in this year. In this context we need more money to finance appropriate celebrations on this occasion. That is why we should agree for Art Inc.     You are right that the opening speech is very prestigious activity so in case when you would agree with my standpoint above I can agree for sharing presentation tasks as following: opening speech by you and giving awards by me or alternatively to not favour anybody we can find the third party to do these tasks. I hope you will understand my standpoint and agree with it. I am looking forward for your answer. Regards, Alex
Hi Alex, Your arguments are clear to me now.  Please find here an offer for a compromise from my side. As the finanical aspect seems most important to you, I am willing to accept your proposed Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. , in case you second my concerns about the local focus by selecting Catering: local Russian cuisine  and Music Act: Local Russian band . As for the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris , thank you for your proposal. I am willing to accept your initial proposal and do the awards myself, lleaving the speech to you. What do you think about that? Overall it sounds like a win-win-situation with a balanced distribution of arguments incl. 3 (of 5) of your initially proposed issues. Hopefully looking forward to an agreement! Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, thank you for your counterproposition. I think it is quite good but I am still not sure if local Russian cuisine will be a good choice. It is really very risky to serve such a cuisine during an international event. Please, think it over one more time because the thing is first of all that this event should be unusual but without any additional upleasant surprises. Regards, Alex
Hey Alex, Obviously that seems to be pretty important to you. Let's pick up both aspects the need for formality and your concern on making somebody unhappy due to food selection and therefore choose the international menu. I willing to take this compromose if your offer to have you do the awards and me the opening  speech. Do I understand you correctly that you are fine with Music Act: Local Russian band  as you didn't mention this anymore. Please cconfirm - in this case we can come to a final agreement, i.e. International menu Week 3 Local Russian band Awards Alex, Speech Chris Art Inc Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, thank you for your reconsidering of catering. I agree for your proposal and therefore it's ok for me when it comes to speech given by you and music act performed by local Russian band. I think that now we can reach a conclusion. I am looking forward for your final approval of our arrangements. Regards, Alex  
Dear Alex, Seems we're getting to terms. Very nice. There is one tiny bit in my proposal that you may have overseenn, so I formulate my proposal to an offer: I am (still) willing to go with your apparently most important issue of the well known sponsor and internationalness in terms of catering, while also satisfying the formal need for our business people - so here's my deal: I second for your main points in case we compromise having international catering, but still a formal menu. (Just in case please look it up in my last message.) I trust your professionalism and attitude towards finding common ground on this last point as I do it myself. Looking forward to your confirmation. Have a good evening, Chris
Dear Chris, sorry for my misunderstanding. It happened because I think that international buffet is better and professional, too. During many conferences and events such buffets are organised because then people are free to move around and talk while eating and can get to know other people and make new contacts. For me it is not inconsistent with the formal idea of the event. I hope you understand me. Regards, Alex
"Hi Chris, Let me speak openly. Honestly I am little disappointed. I would expect an equal will to compromise as I am offering it. If I may quote you ""During many conferences and events such buffets are organised because then people are free to move around"". You mentioned earlier that you don't have experience with events of this size. Nonetheless yours were successfull which I fully respect. However, I do have certain experience with business people from a job I had in a bank alongside my studies. So, this is why I know expectations and formal protocols. I'm still convinced we may come to terms. Please consider taking a final little step, the way I respected your major concerns and experiences. If this is no option for you, I am willing to accept the international buffet if you overthink the Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  and we pick Boomerang. Please respect that I expect a balanced solution - it's a simple quid pro quo. Kind regards, Chris"
Hi Chris, after reconsidering the situation for sake of conference and ISA organisation I agree for your last proposal. This is summing-up our arrangements: Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   I hope that I summed up everything properly and we have reached a final conclusion. Regards, Alex
Dear Alex, I hereby send my acceptance of our collaboration. I feel we have achieved the best for the sake of the conference, both aiming to find the best positions for the conference willing to compromise and instead of putting oneself in the first row. Looking forward to hopefully working together with you at the conference. I would gladly be doing projects together with you in the future. Have a great day, Chris
Hallo, now i send you the calculated unility.I hope you can consider waht i say. thank you         best wishes 
Hello Alex, I see your proposal and see space for improvement. I am sending you my counter-offer. I think that since this is going to take place in Russia and we want them to be our future partner we should impress them by hiiring a local Russian band as well as try the local Russian cuisine. We had a similiar conference back in 2004 in Russia, and it didn't work back then so good, so adapting a little bit to the Russian culture would do us much good in the long run. As for the sponsor goes, I guess I can agree on Boomerang. For the Date of conference i would prefer Week 3, okay its christmass time but we can do it. And I really want to have the speech, and you can have the awards, Ive been in ISA for a long time and this is my chance to present myself so this is something rather important to me. Other than that I think the your offer was okay, we just need to smooth out a few of this errors. Best regards Alex, Chris.
hallo,Chris, i have considered and read your count-offer. I have someplace already changed. Could you spend a little time to read my new offer. I think then there will be progress in this matter. In the first step. We all agree with that the sponsor Boomerang it's ok for us . Secondlly ,For the date of the conference i think week 3 it's also be ok for me. Maybe week 4 is much longer. Then, i'd glad that you want to have the spreech, i can have the awards. I think you have ability to do well and it's your chance. It's not so easy to have a opportunity like this time and you should hold it. And at the same time you have your own experience. I think you are the best and everything will be perfect. What is the important for me it's the Catering. I think the conference so important. I prefer to the International three cource meal. On this way maybe much better adapt for the most of other people. And the international meal it's official . Because this meeting is significant for us. And rightful the music of the typ local rissian band be ok. On this way we can also publicise our culture and it's also be useful to that  them be our future partner. I hope you can consider my opinion and we can achieve ï¿½Win-Winï¿½.     best wishes  Alex
Okay, I would rather prefer the local russian cuisine, but you also accepted a few of my suggestions, and the deal is not that bad in the end.  So, it was nice negotiating this with you, Take care Alex, Chris.
Hello Chris, I hope you are doing well! My name is Alex and I'm your team member for this year's ISA competition. I'm very much looking forward to working with you and very curious about your ideas and suggestions. I'm sure together we'll find a great concept for the conference and that they will like. I would like now to begin by suggesting the attached agenda. Please let me know what you think about it and if that seems acceptable to you. Looking forward to your reply! Yours sincerely, Alex  
Hello Alex, Thank you for your message. I hope you are doing well too! I am looking forward to work with you too and I'm sure we'll do a great job for the competition. I think you did a good job in your first concept. I agree that Week 3 would be the best one suited for having the festivity. However, I would propose some minor changes. In my opinion, having a local band playing at the gala would send a very strong symbol from ISA, approaching the culture of Russia. Therefore it would be better to organise a russian band. This would, in my eyes, make also the evening more special. Listening to DJ Happy songs in the Disco is OK, but for such an festive event it would be a bit in the wrong place. For a similar reason, I would prefer to also serve russian cuisine. It would highlight the arrival of the ISA organisation in Russia and underline our excitement on being able to provide our services in Russia too (also, russian cooking is excellent!). I think Art. Inc is a good sponsor, but I would slightly prefer Boomerang. The reason being, that they provide some long-term sponsoring of our upcoming events, which would be highly valuable for ISA. I hope we can agree on that. I also would suggest to switch the presentation tasks, if you don't mind. I have been in the organisation for a long time and I have accumulated an amount of very interesting subjects which should be adressed in the opening speech. I am curious what you think of my offer. I eagerly await your response. Yours sincerely, Chris
Hello Chris, I hope you are having a great day!  Thank you for your reply, it was interesting to see your point of view and I'm happy we both agree that week 3 is the best option for the conference. As far as your other points are concerned, I'd like to make an alternative proposal.  I like your idea of approaching the Russian culture, but that's not exactly how I look at it. Since the ISA conference is a very internationally oriented event, probably not everybody likes or is familiar with Russian cuisine. I would therefore suggest to offer an internatinal buffet so that everybody is able to find something they like. In addition, this would encourage networking as a buffet usually contributes to a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. I consider this as very important because networking is one of the most important things at such events. In return for this, I'd be willing to accept your suggestion for the music act. I reconsidered and agree with you on the point that DJ Happy might not be the right choice for such an event. In addition, a local Russian band would still approach the Russion culture to a high degree, which seems to be very important for you. I think we both agree that the opening speech is probably the personally most prestigious task and that both of us want to do that. I would however be willing to switch the tasks (as you proposed) if you in return accept Art Inc. as this years sponsor. You yourself said that you only slightly prefer Boomerang so I hope that would be OK for you. I'd like to select Art Inc. because they offer more money than Boomerang and a short-term payment directly for the event. I understand your point that a long-term sponsorship sounds appealing, but I doubt we will have problems  finding a good sponsor over the next years so I would be great if could agree on that. How do you feel about that? I hope you like my new offer and am looking foward to your response! Have a great day, Alex    
"Hello Alex, I hope you are doing fine! Thank you for your interesting proposal. I think we are on the right path to find a great solution. I pondered thoroughly on your suggestions and I have yet another proposal to make you. I am sure that it will strike you as more fitting than my last. On the subject of the catering, I still don't think that a buffet would suit the style of our event very well. Remember, this is a very special event for the ISA. I can't fully understand how networking would be easier with a buffet; at a buffet people are just meeting for a couple of moments, maybe exchanging names and shortly professions. Nothing substantial does really emerge from that. I would think that for networking, we should really have a proper sit-down meal where our guests can communicate without haste, in, as you said, a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. However, I understand your viewpoint that an international meal would be more appealing to our international audience. This is why I could agree on choosing an International three course meal. I can see how the higher budget that Art Inc provides may seem interesting. I would still suggest to take Boomerang as a main sponsor. The reason is, that they did not only agree to fund feature events, but also to some extent provide financial security for the ISA itself These are some advantages which are really more worth, in my opinion, than the extra money that Art Inc provides for just this one-time event. In  return for these changes, I will let you gladly take the part of the speech - the most prestigious task, as you said. I am curious if this proposition would be convenient for you. Wish you a great day! Chris"
Good evening Chris, You new proposal did definitely strike me as fitting! Since the catering seems to be a very important issue for you, I'm happy to accept your new offer. An international three course sounds like a very good option to me. Maybe we can have a short stand-up reception in the beginning to give our guests the chance to converse with eath other, but we can decide on that later on. I'm also happy about your generous offer of letting me take the part of the opening speech. Of course, in return I'll accept Boomerang aus our sponsor. Selecting Boomerang as our sponsor has the convenient side-effect that we can save a potential time-consuming sponsor search in the following years. As a little thank you I could - of course only if this is all right with you - address some of your subjects during the opening speech. Let's just confirm the details now: Catering: International three course meal   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   I'd like to thank you for an always fair and interesting negotiation and I would look forward to cooperating with you again. Now let's keep our fingers crossed that ISA likes our concept! See you soon! Best regards, Alex
Dear Chris, this is my first offer: Catering: International buffet Date of Conference: Week 3 Music Act: DJ Happy Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Sincerily Alex
"Hello Alex, thank you for your offer. I think also that the ""week 3"" is the best.  I think that point is finished. The other 4 points I have the following offer to you: Catering: local Russian cuisine   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang     I think that the point with our sponser is very important also for the future. In addition our russian members will be happy when we organize a local russian band. And also the catering should be a local russian cuisine because so we can get an extra point from our new members.   Best regards Chris"
"Hello Chris, I agree with you the best option is ""Week 3"" Date of Conference: Week 3   but I can not go along with you in the other points: Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   I think also that the point with our sponsor is the most important, that is because in my opinion we should continue with our current Sponsor ""Art Inc."" Catering: International three course meal   The conference will take place in Russia but it will be a multicultural event. So will attend people from diferent countries and they will prefer to eat food they like more than russian food. Presentation Tasks: Third person   Presentation Tasks: What do you think about an external speaker. I think also it is a good option and we could dedicate our time to organize other things. Music Act: FreeLife   In addition, the point of Music Act. I have a different opinion. I think is not appropiate to organize with a local russian band. I suggest you think about hiring a Pop Band called ""FreeLife"". I think it could be enough to keep the guest satisfied. Best Regards, Alex  "
"Hello Alex,   why you want a third person? I think that is our chance for our future. My opionion is that we should choose between ""speech by alex and awards by chris"" and ""speech by chris and awards by alex"". My next offer is: Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor is the most important think I we should choose Boomerang if we want a sponsor also for the future and not only for one event. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   You are right that our guests are not only from Russia but howewer we should arrange a catering with local meals. That is a good chance for our not Russian guest to eat Russian food and I think that is also very important. Catering: local Russian cuisine   I think the best is to arrange a local Russian band because so we can show to our guests that we are openly to all cultures. Music Act: Local Russian band     Best regards Chris"
"  Hello Chris, I have been thinking about your offer all day.  Music Act: Local Russian band   I agree with you that the best option to Music Act. is arrange a Local Russian Band and show our guest that we have an open minded for another cultures.  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   The Presentation Tasks I agree with you too.   Catering: International buffet   However, I don't have the same opinion with the Catering. The conference will take place during one week so our guest will be able to eat some russian food other days. The best option I think is an ""International Buffet"" and we will not any problems with the Catering in this way. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   In this point, I have the same opinion like you because it is the most important. However, I prefer to not get risks and stay with our current Sponsor. I gave you the reason with the Local Russian Band and with the Presentation Tasks. I think this option now is the best.  Sincerily, Chris"
Hello Alex,   I agree with you at all 4 items: Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.     In prinziple you are right that the people can eat some Russian food all other days but it is only possible if they have the time. If they have no time then it is not possible for our guests. If I am in an another country the first thing is to make a research what they culture is and what can I eat there. We have now the chance to combine the Russian music with Russian food. I think then we have the best decision. I am assured that our guests will be excited.   Best regards Chris
"Hello Chris, I have been reading your proposal about Local Russian Food carefully and I am sorry but I can't go along with you. That is the last point of our negotiation so we should take care about choose the correct option. Before my decision, I wanted to remember you what is about our business. We are a multinational organisation that develops leadership skills through our internal leadership programmes. We are not a Restaurant that offer some typical food of the region. We should focus on our Presentations Tasks. As I can see, your best option is ""Local Russian Food"" and my case is ""International Three Course Meal"", that's because I have proposed you to be as fair as possible to choose the option ""International Buffet"". So if you are agree, we can finish the negotiation with all this items. Date of Conference: Week 3 Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Catering: International buffet   It has been a pleasure negotiating with you. Best Regards Alex"
Hello Alex,   I have the following offer to you. I think it is a fair for both. Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang     I hope that we can finish the conversation now.   Best regards Chris
Hey Chris, I thought it was all agreed. I mean it is the best option  Why did you change one of the other items that we had alredy agreed?  Are you trying to cheating me? I offered you the best option and now you are changing what we had already agreed before.  If I were you I would read the offer that we agreed another time. Think twice. I hope that you finally accept and we can finish the conversation right now. Sincerely Alex
Hello Alex,   no, that is not my aim. I am trying to get the best offer for me and you also. So I can increase my percentage, that's all.   Best regards Chris
"Hello Chris, Obviously you want to get your best percentage and me also. We had arrived an agreement but you changed the sponsor. So, I have decided to change the Music Act ""DJ HAPPY"" staying the rest of items in the same way. So now my last offer has the following items: Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Today is the last day to finish our negotiation. I hope to arrive an agreement. Best regards, Alex"
Hello Alex,   I think that offer is also acceptable. Thank you for the negotiation.   Best regards Chris
Hi Chris, How are you? I'm contacting you to settle the remaining issues concerning our concept for the competition. I think the ideas we already agreed upon are great and we totally have a chance of winning the competition. It is now important to settle the remaining issues, especially the date of the conference. It will be difficult to reach agreements with the possible sponsors and music acts without having a definitive date. I suggest that we carry out the conference in the third week Date of Conference: Week 3 , which would still be in the first half of december, not too close to christmas and very close to the actual foundation date 40 years ago (December 8th). Are you fine with this? I hope to hear from you soon and I am really looking forward to planning the actual event with you. Best regards Alex
"Hi Alex! Thank you for contacting me. I am happy having you as a partner; we surely are able to achieve good results if we work together on the remaining issues. I think that we will come to an agreement soon. Concerning the date of the conference, I would've proposed the same. Most people, especially ISA's higher ranked members should be able to attend the conference in week 3. So there is no need to discuss this topic any further. How about we move on to the catering? As you know, this year's conference is a very special one. Celebrating the 40th anniversary together with the opening of the first subsidiary in Russia will certainly attract many important people. To make a good first impression it is necessary to keep a certain level of formality. Thus I would strongly dislike offering our guests a simple buffet. The conference is the perfect place to establish contacts to many local business people, which is essential for a successful start of the new office. In my experience it always pays off to adapt to the local culture. Therefore I would rate the local Russian cuisine as the best choice. What is your opinion on this topic?  Best regards Chris"
Dear Chris, I am really happy we were able to settle this first issue so quickly. I think we are making great progress and our concept will be a success. Concerning the catering, however, I have some doubts whether the local Russian cuisine really is in line with ISAï¿½s international orientation. I am aware that adapting to the local culture can have many advantages when opening ï¿½normalï¿½ business subsidiaries. However, just as you mentioned in your last message, we are also celebrating the 40th anniversary of our student organisation and the majority of guests will most certainly not be familiar with the Russian cuisine. An international buffet Catering: International buffet  could combine international food most of our members like with Russian specialities. Regarding the formality you wish to maintain at the conference, I would like to remind you that the ISA is a student organisation. A relaxed atmosphere suits our actual client base. Moreover, the conference will be a great possibility for networking. It is obvious that a buffet encourages networking by providing possibilities to meet new people. An international buffet will perfectly be in line with the performance of DJ Happy Music Act: DJ Happy, who is my preferred alternative for the music act. His performance will attract many young and ambitious guests ï¿½ the bosses of tomorrow ï¿½ and will put an end to the dissatisfaction with the music acts from the last events. I hope that I have been able to convince you. I am very confident that we will find a solution that fits both our preferences. Best regards Alex
"Dear Alex, Concerning your doubts about the catering, most of our guests will either be Russian business man or ISA Members with a full time job, which aren't students anymore and already have a certain age. The relaxed atmosphere you mentioned is the best choice when it comes to actually work with other students, but is not suited for this special event. Our primary goal is the successful opening of our new subsidiary, and we will achieve this goal only by meeting our Russian guestï¿½s expectations. We need to do the first step to establish as many contacts as possible. The right way to do this is by showing appreciation to the Russian culture in some way. For this reason, I would recommend a 3-Meal-Russian cuisine as well as a local artist to perform on this event. I'm not sure that DJ Happy is the best choice when it comes to the music act. You are right saying that the music acts of the previous years were total disasters, but I fear that DJ Happy is way too big to perform as a ""side-act"" on our conference. He's just too famous; his reputation will overshadow the reputation of ISA and prevent the important networking. People would come to our conference to see him performing and not to learn more about ISA. A more decent artist like FreeLife or the local Russian band would be more fitting for this event.    Obviously we still have big differences concerning our preferences, but I am sure that we will settle these issues soon. Maybe we can meet in the middle and choose a Russian cusine with an international act or vice versa.  Greetings Chris"
Dear Chris, Thank you for your message. You are right saying that our opinions about what is best for the event differ substantially. I understand your arguments but I still think that we need to put the students in the focus of the event. In my opinion, it does not make sense to discuss these profound differences any further. It is now far more important to not forget that in the end, we both want the conference to contribute to ISA's sustainable success. Therefore, I appreciate that you are willing to settle for a compromise. I suggest that we offer an international buffet Catering: International buffet and hire the local Russian band Music Act: Local Russian band. This will definitely encourage networking and is a nice solution for our problem. I assume that you are happy with this compromise. We can now go on discussing the remaining issues. Concerning the Sponsor Selection, I suggest that we accept Art Inc.'s offer Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.. Even though they did not offer a long-term contract, we have a good and lasting relationship with this company and I do not see any reasons why they would stop supporting us. Selecting their competitor Boomerang could threaten this valuable relationship. What is your opinion on the sponsor selection? I am already looking forward to your answer and am happy that we were able to find our first compromise solution. I am convinced that our concept will turn out great even though our opinions on some issues differ. Have a nice day. Best regards Alex  
Dear Alex, Thank you for your reply. I'm relieved having a partner who is also willing to settle for a compromise in certain issues. I think your proposal is a good arrangement, which should satisfy both our expectations. Concerning the Sponsor Selection, I think it's insufficient to rely on unpredictable relationships. I am aware that Art Inc. has donated some money for different events in the past, but the future will always remain unstable. Boomerang is offering just slightly less for the conference, and the contract they are willing to sign would guarantee us the sponsoring of all future events together with some extend for the ISA itself. I'm convinced that financial stability is one of the most important matters we need to ensure, and Boomerang will give us this stability. I'm sure that you will understand my doubts. Let's start discussing about the Presentation Task, the last issue we need to settle. I don't think that hiring a third person is a rational option for us. We did all the work organising the conference, so we should get recognition for it. Moderating the opening ceremony by ourselfs is the best way reach a broad audience and to make a lasting impression. I would recommend seperating the two parts between us, sharing them would cause an additional coordination effort. Therefore I suggest the option Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex . I hope you agree with me! With these arrangements we definetly have a big chance to win the competion. Best wishes Chris  
Dear Chris, I am relieved that we have found another compromise and that our concept is getting better and better. In spite of our progess, I am afraid that our preferences concerning the main sponsor still differ. I see the advantages of having a long-term contractual agreement with a sponsor. However, my main concern is that if we disappoint Art Inc. now, also other companies will lose trust in ISA and we could lose other important business contacts. Concerning the presentation tasks, I agree that we should get credit for all our work and it would not be the best alternative to let a third person do the hosting of the event. When it comes to the task segregation between the two of us, I would love to do the opening speech instead of the award announcement. I think we both know that the opening speech is more prestigious and that the one of us who does the opening speech can leave a more lasting impression and reach a broader audience than the one who hosts the award announcement. Nevertheless, I am willing to let you do the opening speech if we can agree on Art Inc. as the main sponsor. What do you think about this compromise? I am very happy with our concept and am looking forward to hand it in. Best wishes Alex
Dear Alex, You are right, our concept is getting better and better. I'm already proud of our work, no matter if we win this competition or not.  But I am sorry, I still can't agree on your choice of the Sponsor. ISA has become one of the biggest student organisations, operating with several other companies on an international basis. I don't see how the change of one single contract should endanger all the other relationships we build over the past years. Besides, changing a partner is an absolutely normal process in an organisation. We are just seeking for a stable future, and I am sure that every other company will comprehend our wish, since we never even had a long lasting contract with Art Inc. Concerning the presentation task, providing the opening speech is indeed the more prestigeous part, which could have a high impact on our future developement in ISA. I won't mind letting you take this opportunity, if we can agree on Boomerang as our future sponsor.  After this whole work is over, we definitely should meet someday and have a drink together!  Best wishes! Chris
Dear Chris, I really do appreciate you as a partner and I especially like your open communication. I understand your arguments but I am still convinced that my arguments are more significant. Let's not forget that Art Inc. also offered a higher amount of money for the event, which shows that they trust us and are obviously interested in keeping us as a partner. In my opinion, there is simply no reason to change to a sponsor who pays less just because the company offers to sign a long-term contract. ISA is such a successful organisation and I do not see why Art Inc. would stop supporting us unless we choose their competitor as a main sponsor. In the unlikely case that they will stop supporting us nevertheless, it will be easy to find new promising sponsors. We should be a little bit more confident! Let me explain to you that before we started to plan our concept, I had a very specific idea of the event I wanted to plan. Keeping Art Inc. as a sponsor is very crucial to me and by selecting Boomerang I would deviate too much from my original idea. I hope you understand how much this means to me and hope that our concept will be complete by tomorrow. I still think that we will win the competition. I also would love to have a drink or two with you and think we will get along great even though our opinions on the event differ somehow. Best wishes Alex    
Dear Alex,   I also appreciate you as a partner and it has been a great pleasure negotiating with you.   Concerning the Sponsor selection, I think we both came up with some valuable arguments. You aren't wrong saying that a little confidence has rarely hurt someone, but I still think that eliminating this risk factor is the better option for ISA. The money they are offering for this event is more than enough to provide us a professional concept, worth winning the competition. Nevertheless, I don't think that it makes much sense to continue arguing on this topic. I guess we have to find another way to settle our differences.   In your last message you mentioned the importance of selecting the sponsor for you. As your partner I certainly care for your preferences and therefore I try to negotiate as cooperative as possible. But as you can imagine, certain issues we discussed are equally important for me. I guess we have very similar goals, referring to the issues we want to settle. Besides choosing the sponsor, having a Russian cuisine for the conference is the second most significant issue I wanted to achieve. When we were discussing this topic, I was willing to restrain this wish in order to make a progress in our negotiations.   It would be very disappointing, not to have a complete concept until the negotiation is over. To come to an agreement I offer you a fair setup, which respects both our preferences in some way. If you have the same goals as I do, this arrangement is even favoring you. Therefore I see no rational reason to decline this offer.   I hope that you feel the same and that you will accept my offer!   Best wishes   Chris  
Dear Chris, thank you for your message. Even though I really do appreciate negotiating with you, I think it is quite unprofessional to start discussing issues we both agreed on at such an advanced stage of the negotiation. I hope you are aware that we have to hand in our concept today and as you said it would be disappointing not to find a solution we are both happy with. As my main goal is still to win the competition and to hand in a good concept, I decided to accept your offer from yesterday. In my opinion this is a great concession but I am still happy we could find a solution and our concept is now ready to be handed it. Have a nice weekend Best regards Alex
Dear Alex, Thank you for accepting yesterday's offer. I'm sure you won't regret your decision, we managed to negotiate a great concept for ISA. Best wishes Chris  
 Dear Chris  I am writing to define the aspects of the 40th anniversary event organization left.  In my view we should solve the issue related to the selection of the main sponsor as soon as possible. I think that that 40th anniversary would be the most important event organized by the ISA so far, also because it will also be combined with the celebration of the newly established subsidiary in Saint Petersburg. You know how much this means for us: it is has been a long time since the organization desires to establish an office in Russia. For this reasons we need the more money in the fastest way. Among all the sponsors Art Inc. made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event. We really need to know our budget as soon as we can, in this way, after figuring out all the costs, we can know for certain what we can afford for the event organization. I think that we should pick up Art Inc as our main sponsor also because the company has supported  the organization for a long time and I am sure it will keep on doing it. As we both know the event will be one of the most important in the ISA history, so we have to celebrate it properly. I collected some feedbacks on the previous events organized by ISA and I noticed that a lot of people expressed their dissatisfaction for the guests with the music acts of the events. In my view I think that hiring DJ Happy would be perfect for this event. We both know that he is popular in all over the world for his music and in particular for his concerts that are always sold-out, thatï¿½s why I am sure that his presence will attract many guests. For this reasons I guess that DJ Happy will fit well with the mission of the association: attract fresh members to create a large network of students connected in all over the word. As the number of associates will increase we will also become automatically  more attractive for our business partners. If  we can attract more potentially future talents in the ISA, then more business partners will be willing to collaborate with the ISA to get easier access to these talents. Given the expected high number of attendee coming from all over the world I definitely think that it is better to offer to our guests an international mixture of food, so everybody will be able to find something they like. The atmosphere of the event should facilitate networking: thatï¿½s why a buffet will suit best our needs to create a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere.  Last but not least, we have to decide which is the best week to host the event. To me it wonï¿½t be pleasant if the organisationï¿½s vice president and the ISAï¿½s higher ranked members wonï¿½t be able to attend the event (since they will be probably the people evaluating the concepts) so I think that we have to exclude the second week of December as a possible timeslot.   The third week would be a nice timeslot to host the event since the following weeks are too close to the Christmas holidays. Please think about my proposals and let me know what you think about them as soon as possible. I am sure we will do a great job together  Best regards Alex
Dear Alex, Nice to hear from you!  Thank you for the e-mail with so constructive proposal. I agree with you that 40th anniversary would be the most important event organized by the ISA. But we have to take into account that this yearï¿½s competition is especially important to the ISA, since an earlier attempt to establish an office in Moscow had failed in 2004 due to unforeseen problems in the preparation and due to silly thing of the organizers who forgot that the Russians and Russian culture are not the same like others European cultures. I suggest to forget about our own benefits from this event and try to organize this anniversary celebrations on the top level. Let's go point by point   1. Sponsor Selection You are right that Art Inc. made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event. And let's not forget that  Boomerang also made a very good offer and they are our best partner at least last 20 years. So I suppose it will not look so attractive for our, I hope, future partners in Russia that we are ready to change our partners to money. Also as you know that Art Inc. has always donated some money for different events. However, without a written contract regarding the future, Art Inc. can always decide to change their intentions. In our case with the failed  Moscow event in 2004 it could be thoughtless action. And Boomerang hasn't never let us down. So on the ground this 2 facts (failed Moscow and trusted partner) I suggest accept the  Boomerang's offer. 2.Music Act I know, I have the same some feedbacks on the previous events organized by ISA. Let's not forget it is Russia and it isn't the typical event. Also Saint Petersburg is a culture capital of Russia so no one will expect DJ at the even of such level  (40th anniversary celebrations). Many important people will  be there who expect a certain level of formality. So I suggest invite more formal band and it the best case Russian band because of it is an easy way to show ISAï¿½s interest in the Russian culture. The Russians like it. I know them little bit ). 3. Catering I would really dislike having a buffet at the conference. Having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. But here I repeat myself is Russia so I think that local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. Also we can amaze our international friend from other countries with Russians food. Where can you taste the  Russian food? ))) 4.Date of conference There is a great deal of truth in what you said. I need some time to think it over and we can stay the 3d week, as you said, for the present. 5.Presentation Tasks I know that you have much more experience as I am, so I suggest to shared activities if you arenï¿½t against it.   I am sure  also we will do a great job together What do you think about my remarks about Russians and our first impression to them? Do you have other ideas?   With best regards,   Chris
"Thank you for your feedbacks Chris! I liked some of the ideas you proposed, but I still have a different view regarding some points. As concerns the sponsorï¿½s selection I know that Boomerang made a good offer, but the amount of money offered by Art Inc is higher.     I know that they said that if we choose them as the main sposor, they will sign a long-term contract for the sponsoring of future events, but I think that Art Incï¿½s offer still remains the best one. First of all Art Incï¿½s offer is more beneficial for us because it guarantees to the association more money and in a faster way. Moreover, Art Inc has supported the ISA for a long time, therefore I am sure that their support will continue in the future. The only reason why they could change their mind would be selecting Boomerang (which is a direct competitor of Art Inc.) as the main sponsor. If we are going to disrupt all of a sudden the trust relationship that exists between the ISA and Art Inc it wouldn't be beneficial for our reputation, and as you said before it would not make us look appealing to the potential Russian partners.   I am sure that Russians will enjoy a local band to play at the event but donï¿½t forget that our is an international organization! People from all over the world will attend, I guess that for those of them who donï¿½t know the Russian language it will be very hard to enjoy a Russian band singing for the whole night. I guess that since many important people will attend the event we can let down the DJ set and hire a band. For the reasons I explained before, I would rather opt for a pop band. We can contract the band FreeLife, they are quite popular and I guess that all our guests will be satisfied with their performance. We have to learn by the mistakes done in the past: we should not run the risk to get the audience bored again, thatï¿½s why I think that a pop band would be largely appreciated by our guests, rather than a band which will only play local song in Slavic. I am sorry, but I donï¿½t agree with the choice of the food. Since our is an international organization people from all over the world will attend, thus many of the guests will probably be unfamiliar with the local cuisine. I think that it would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everyone would be able to find something they like. Of course some Russian dishes will be offered in the buffet, but we should also give the possibility to our guests to go for an alternative. Trust me, I already had some experience in organising events and I saw that many people do not dare to eat something they are not used to or are just afraid to ask what are the ingredients of a dish they have not seen before. With the wide variety of dishes that only a buffet can offer everyone will be able to find something that will suit his needs. Regarding the presentation tasks: as you said before I have more experience in organizing and managing events, so maybe it would be better if I do the opening speech. I guess that due to my experience I will be able to break the ice with the very first speech and then you will manage the awarding ceremony. To handle the large audience that will listen to the opening speech one should have the experience needed to handle the public and donï¿½tï¿½ hesitate while speaking; I am sure that if we prepare together the speech I will be able to manage the situation in the proper way. After my ï¿½warm-upï¿½ it would be easier for you to go on the stage and give the awards. As I read in your previous message we both agree that the third week of December would be the perfect time slot to host the event. Letï¿½s stick to this date, I am happy that we reached a point regarding the date of the event, I am sure that we will keep going to collaborate so nicely.   Hoping that you will appreciate my proposals I send my best regards Alex "
"Hey Alex,   I've read all of  yours remarks and some of them are very much to the point. MUSIC ACT ""event but donï¿½t forget that our is an international organization! People from all over the world will attend, I guess that for those of them who donï¿½t know the Russian language"" But it doesnï¿½t mean that this band will sing the whole evening only Russians songs and in Russian. In Russian there are a lot of jazz bands, classic bands, pop bands and so on. In my opinion, the success of the ISA has always been partly due to the successful adoption of local culture and so it is a vital part of creating a good relationship with your future business partners in Russia. The atmosphere of the event should thus reflect some local cultural aspects while being a very enjoyable conference for all visitors. In additional this another scandal with FreeLife and it's view of Russian policy ï¿½ I am afraid that they can use this event for another scandal. Could you image how it can affect of ISA's reputation in Russia? I don't like to run risks and to fail the second time, especially before the upcoming 40th anniversary. CATERING I repeat myself  ""having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes"". But on the other hand you are right that ""many people do not dare to eat something they are not used to or are just afraid to ask what are the ingredients of a dish they have not seen before."" So I can suggest using a trade-off decision for us. Because of the upcoming 40th anniversary I suggest using an international three course meal and thus wouldn't harm the prestige of the ISA. On the other hand we could present this catering as a special Russian type of catering and it wonï¿½t be lie because ""Service ï¿½ la russe"" is now the style in which most modern Western restaurants serve food and for the first time it appeared in Russia. So we can show to our future in Russia our interest of Russia and Russian culture.   SPONSOR SELECTION I guess it could be the most complex issue of our discussion. I suggest that the option without future perspectives as a factor of uncertainty which can only hurt the ISA in the long run. I want to make sure that also the financial perspective of ISA is safe for the upcoming years. Art Inc cannot give us such insurance arrangements and they are ready to work with us only by word of mouth. So I dare say that Boomerang will be more fail-safe partner in longterm perspective. PRESENTATION TASKS I don't believe that it wouldn't be fairly. Judge for yourself your opening speech will be only maximum 20 minutes and I will on the stage the whole event. I guess it doesn't fair with respect to you DATE OF THE CONFERENCE May be you misunderstood me, but I need some time to consult with my business partner in Russia and choose the best time on base his advice. As you know I have joined the ISA in 2010 in the context of a student internship at one of the business partners of ISA. Since then, I cooperate with business contacts of ISA in order to help organizing internships for other students on a voluntary basis and therefore have gained knowledge about these business contacts and their interests. So I have some business partner in Russia who can advice me the  best date of conference.   It must be admitted that before the competition started, I used my existing business contacts to inquire carefully about the competitionï¿½s winner selection criteria and job chances. He told me that the main selection criteria is the team performance and they have two jobs will be offered to the best performing team. I hope it could decrease the level of our conflicts and we can concentrate on the best organization of the upcoming 40th ISA anniversary.   With best regards   Chris"
I didn't get your point about the Presentation Tasks. Can you please rephrase what you meant to say about it in your previour mail?  Thanks a lot
Oh, sorry. I mean we spend our time for this project and preparation. And I'll get all fame at this event as a presenter? Like the speech near 20 minutes and the awards near the whole evening. So after this evening I'll be associated with the main person who organized this anniversary event. It's not fair to you. So I suggest to share activities
I think that the choice of a Russian local band is not the best choice for the ISA. In my view the music act should be used as a leverage to attract more people to the event: who will recognize a local band? Remember that the name of the artist that will play at the event will be written in all the advertising we will make to promote the event. Who will be attracted by an merely local group? Regarding the catering, the three course meal is not my favorite choice but I think is a good compromise. An elements recalling the Russian culture should be present in the event, so I agree with you to have as catering a three course meal served with ï¿½Service ï¿½ la Russeï¿½. I think it is enough as a cultural adaptation to satisfy our local stakeholder, thatï¿½s why I believe that we will dare to much choosing a Russian band. In my view we can reach a middle field: I will follow you supporting the choice of a three course meal served with ï¿½Service ï¿½ la Russeï¿½, but only if you accept my suggestion to hire DJ Happy for the Music Act. Hiring a well known artist will be more beneficial to arose the interest of new student fellows. For example if we will sponsor our event saying that the dj set will be performed by DJ Happy, we will immediately start an huge word of mouth. I think that this is a good middle field solution: the international characterization of the International Student Association will be reflected in the music performance, while the linkage with the new established subsidiary will be mirrored in the choice of the Catering.   For the task presentation: I will feel more confident to deliver the presentation speech because I am more trained to do it. In my view you will be more competent to give the award to our more old and loyal business partners because you are more experienced in dealing with our business partners since your work is to managing the business contacts for the ISA.     For the sponsor choice: according to me letting down Art Inc will harm our reputation to the eyes of Russians potentially future partners. Since it intercourse a trust relationship between ISA and Art Inc for more than 20 years, I think that this will not be a wise move the image of the association. Art Inc. has supported the ISA for a long time, therefore I am sure that their support will continue in the future. Moreover we have to think about the persons that will choose the winners of the contest: they are the senior members of the organization, thus they have been collaborating with Art Inc for 20 years, I think that the choice of another company as sponsor will erode our chance to win the competition because of this. I am sure that if we select Boomerang (which is a direct competitor of Art Inc.) as the main sponsor Art Inc will say goodbye forever to the ISA, I am not sure that the selection committee responsible to choice the winners will not be happy with that.
"I supposed that here ""I guess that since many important people will attend the event we can let down the DJ set and hire a band"" you agreed with me and we concurred with DJ is bad decision for the event of such level. Or did it mean something different? Well, in this case I find this negotiations are quite unproductive and unconstructive.   ""I will follow you supporting the choice of a three course meal served with ï¿½Service ï¿½ la Russeï¿½, but only if you accept my suggestion to hire DJ Happy for the Music Act."" It sounds little bit like a blackmail. Isn't it?"
I guess I have to correct myself, I will accept the three course meal if you let down the local Russian band, that is to say if we are commonly willing to hire the Pop BandMusic Act: Free Life. I am sorry for this misunderstanding Chris. You should anyway appreciate the fact that I am giving away my positions for choices that I personally donï¿½t like that much, in order to find a compromise. As you have noticced, to me the choice of the Music Artist was a very important aspect related to the event organization, but in order to arrive to a decision I try to meet your desire. It is very important to find a way to arrive to a common solution for the event concept that will be judged by the ISA senior committee. I am doing it because I really want the two og us to win the competition.
"Ok, let's try to find a compromise. As I have already said finally my business partner from Russia called me you informed that the best date of conference is the 5th week of December. ""You should anyway appreciate the fact that I am giving away my positions for choices that I personally donï¿½t like that much, in order to find a compromise."" I understand that but I did force you to agree with me. So now I suggest this offer with adjusted for the last information from my business Russian partner.   How do find it? It is with all our corrections and commentaries. Is it ok for you?"
I believe this is not fair Chris. I mean, since your previous message has been really taught in stating how much you valued the fair play of the other partner, I would have expected form you a more cooperative attitude in the team work for organizing the event. You already knew all the information regarding the most suitable week to host the event right from the start, so why do you are playing tricky in this way? I donï¿½t get why you have to use strategies. I can understand discussing and reaching compromises on topics in which we have different point of views, but I donï¿½t think is fair the fact that  you are pretending to have acquired new information just for your personal return (I am referring to the choice of the week to host the ceremony). Moreover in your last counter offer you returned back to your previous positions. I will say it once again: we should try to find compromises and adopt a more cooperative attitude: I alredy did it in accepting your last compromise regarding the catering, try to do the same. We will both lose or win the competition, remember we are a team .
"Alex, Of course I know that it is unfair and I am glad that you see it also. I just wanna to show you how it is unpleasant when you spent a lot of time and energy, arranged, spend time to find a compromise and then your partner rolled back to previous positions. So I suggest as we arranged on the base of fair: Catering - International three course meal. Believe me - the best solution for me is russian food. But I tried and found how we can present this ""International three course meal"" in line of our respect to our new hypothetical partners. Also I suggest return back to our previous arrangements with ""Date of Conference"" and ""Music Act"". So we have to talk over two points - ""Presentation Tasks"" and ""Sponsor Selection"". If it is really important for you I could let you open the event with the speech and forget about my idea to share activities. But could I expect the changing of your position with ""Sponsor Selection""?"
"Ok Chris, first of all tell me if we both agree on the choice of Catering: International three course meal  Music Act: FreeLife  and Date of Conference: Week 3   The least messages have been quite confusing for me, so if you confirm that I understood properly what you meant before, this is the current state of the situation: we have still to decide the ""Presentation Tasks"" and the ""Sponsor Selection"". I think that the ""Sponsor Selection"" is the most important topic of our discussion. For what I got from our previous discussions I see that the we differ not in the choice of the company (say Boomerang or Art Inc.), but we value in a different way the trade-off between having money in the present (budget for the event organization) or in the future. To me we should make our best to win the competition, which means present to the organization committee the best event ever. To have a successful event I think that accept the second best offer wonï¿½t be a wise decision, but it doesnï¿½t mean that I donï¿½t value the future financial perspective of the ISA. We both know that Art Inc. made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment and also has offered more money than all the other partners. We know that they have supported the ISA for a long time and therefore I cannot see why they could change their mind for the future. I think that if we donï¿½t give them any reason for doing it they will continue to support us also in the future. Thatï¿½s why I think that their offer is the best one: first we will be judged on the event organization, so having the more money will be better for our event concept, but at the same time with this choice we will also ensure in the future a financial support to the ISA because the trust relationship that has last between our organization and Art Inc. for many years will assure us that the company Art Inc. will continue to stay by our side. The only good reason for them to broke our trust relationship would be Selecting Boomerang  as the main sponsor, since it is one of their direct competitor.   Think first of all that we the only the best team concept will be selected as winner so we so we will judged on the organization of the event first of all, thatï¿½s why I think that Art Inc. would be the best choice.  "
Dear Alex, you explained perfectly your position, but don't understand me wrong. This future perspectives that Art Inc. will be our sponsor is only by oral declaration. I don't take their word for the future sponsorship because of nowadays they have a huge financial problems and they are on the verge of bankruptcy. Companyï¿½s representative would also give a short presentation of the company on the main stage during the event. So I suppose they don't want to sign any contract and want to use our platform, event as an investment mobilization place. Therefore I suggest to choose Boomerang eo ipso we can show to ISA: 1. we found a new long term sponsor 2. we sign a longterm contract 3. we avoid any scandal connected with our organisation and Art Inc 4. we save our good name and reputation 5. we found a new trusted employer for our students I hope these arguments are enough to understand why I want to choose Boomerang as a main sponsor.
Are you sure about the information on the Art Inc. financial situation? I think the voice that came to your hear was just a rumor. I didnï¿½t heard any bad news about Art Inc having financial problems. Art Inc is an old parter of ISA, so I think that if this news is real eveybody at ISA would know it. I am quite sure about it because we have a very solid trust relationship with this company. Moreover Art Inc has proposed to give us a big amount of money, (bigger that the other potential sponsors) this would not have any sense if they were at the edge of bankarupcy. I will repeat my self, but we have to value more what is better-off for us in order to organize the best event possible and so to win the competition. Only in this way we will get the job we dream at ISA. The best concept is going to be evaluated also and foremost on the money the team has been able to get form the sponsor to organize the event. So it would be a pity to accept the second best option, in this way I think that the selection commitee would not be happy. The more money we get for the event the more the committee will be impressed with our organization of the event. The competition is based on organize the event in the best way possible to celebrate the 40th anniversary and the establishment of the new Russian subsidiary, it is not a competition on how will find the best investor for the next years.
I have the same opinion as you that we have to find the best solution for the ISA. No, I am absolutely sure that the Art Inc. financial situation is terrible. No one believed that Enron had a problem with finans until Enron scandal was appeared. Arthur Andersen company helped them to hire their losses, nowadays  Arthur Andersen is called Accenture. How can you explain in other case their reluctance to sign any liabilities (longterm or even shortterm)?
"""How can you explain in other case their reluctance to sign any liabilities (longterm or even shortterm)?"" They haven't be reclutant in sign any liability, they just arranged the terms of their proposal in a different way. If they have problems in signing liabilities the would have never proposed us such a big amount of money (the biggest among the proposals we recieved) and they are offering also the best term for the payment. We already decided which is the compromise solution we reached regarding the Music act, so why didn't you put the choice we made of the group that will perform at the event? It is the second time you didn't selected the music art choice in you counteroffer, it seems that you are behaving (for the second time) not according to the decision we made of working in a collaborative way. That's why in your last messagess you seemed to have a pretty uncountructive attitude toward my regards. Please let's try to find a way to make this negotiation productive and behave fairly."
"Dear Alex, As I have already said they want to use us like a platform for their advertising so they are ready pay ""such big"" amount of money. Yes, I see that you don't want to accept my facts and only want to get the solution with the best offer for you. You even don't try constructively give any rebuttals. ""We already decided which is the compromise solution we reached regarding the Music act"". Yes, we reached that Dj is bad decision for the anniversary event and you were agree. Then we found that FreeLife is a startling band who is against Russian policy, so they can make a scurvy trick at our event. And you also were agree. And in spite of you still continue stating FreeLife as a Music Act. I guess you don't read me. And so I don't know how to communicate with you. I give your 1,2,3,4,5... facts, you say me - no, it isn't fair. But where is your facts why we decide your point of view? Let's take most seriously because of we have less than to find any compromise. I am still confident that we shall cope with difficulties   BR Chris"
Dear Chris,  before trying to find a compromise on the sponsor selection I want to clarify the topic music art. Maybe there was a little misunderstanding between us but I never said that I agree in letting down the Pop Band Free life!  My favorite choice was DJ Happy, but then I find a compromise with the Pop Band. I did it to show my cooperative attitudes towards your stances, I believe in this way to have reached a middle filed since I made a compromise on the choice of the catering (which again wasn't my first preference) only because you instead to have the Service ï¿½ la Russï¿½. Time is running fast and the deadline for submitting our proposal for the event organization is tomorrow in the afternoon, so we should try to find a compromise ASAP Best regard   Alex
Yep, you're right. I've misunderstood you. You have never agreed with the russian band statement. Could I explain the train of my thought. Just imagine yourself. You are a good organizer of different events. One day you are asked to organized the 60th anniversary of your ma. And of course the whole family and friends will be there. Your mother likes music and goog food. But you haven't got enough money so you try to find someone who can give you some money and who will be the sponsor of this birthday. You found two sponsors - the first one gives your money once and that's all, the second one gives your little bit less, but they are ready to work with your and will be the sponsor of every your future event giving you a confirmation. Also you found two bands - the play at the same level, but one of them is more popular then second one. But this popular band had early a huge scandal with your mother and there is a nonzero probability that they can wreck her birthday and show asses.  Would be your mother glad to see this popular band at her birthday? What is your desicion in this case? Sponsor and band. Please try to answer for yourself
Remember that the ISA is a STUDENT organization, it is even written in its name! Is true that business people will also attend the event, but just think about it: if we succeed in getting more students interested in the ISA, then the business partners will automatically work with the ISA to get easier access to these future talents, so our main objective hould be enlarge our client base. Attracting students implicitly means attracting businesses! Leveraging such an important event for politics is a definite sign of distancing ISA from its roots and motives. 
I didn't catch you. How is it connected with my questions?
Do you think that the 60th anniversary of your mother can be compared to the organization of the 40th annyversary of the International Student Assosiaction?  Seriously??? Please let's stick to the discussion of the organization of the event and stay with ours feet on the ground.  
Seriously. I drew an analogy for you and you understood perfectly how your position is vacillating. 
Dear Chris,  my counterproposal is to choose Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  only if we choose Music Act: FreeLife  playing at the event and the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   I hope that we can meet in the middle in this way. Best regards  Alex
Dear Alex (Alexander or Alexandra), I hope you don't take this game as referring to yourself. BR Chris
Dear Chris, this is not a game, this is a negotiation. Please consider my last offer and think carefully if it is a good compromise between our positions. I made the best I can to make it work out to find a solution that is satisfing for us both. Regards C.
Dear Alex (C.), In principle I am at all happy with this option. It was very cool to negotiate with you! May I know where my partner (Alex (C.)) from? BR Chris
Dear Chris, in order to conclude the negotiation you have to send me a formal offer, selecting the choices on which we agreed upon previously. I made a mistake in my last message signing me with the wrong letter at the end (atually C. is not even the initial of my real name). Anyway we are not allowed to share personal information. With my best regards Alex
Dear Alex, It was nice to negotiate with you! BR Chris
Hello Chris, it seems that we're one team in this year's competition and that we have to design an interessting concept for the celebration of the 40th anniversary together. As you don't know anything about me, let me introduce myself: I joined the ISA as a student member when I started my studies in 2009. Until now I have some experiences in planning and organising smaller events which were always very successful - you see this isn't my first event i have to plan for. Therefore I've already thought about some issues for the conference. The first thing that was thought about was the musik act. The last years I took part at several ISA events and noticed an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the musik acts. Therefore, I think that some currently famous international act would be exactly the tight thing to attract the kind of dynamic guests the ISA is looking for. Immediatly I thought of DJ Happy, who would be perfect for this event, as he regularly fills huge venues with his events. I'm sure his presence will attract many guest, which could then in turn be interested in the ISA. Another unresolved issue I thought about is the catering. The conference should have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new aquaintances which requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere (but this is my opinion).  Having a very formal three course meal where everybody sits down for several hours with the same people goes completly against that idea. Having a buffett during which you could be free to move around and talk while eating would be more relaxed. Currently, the exact date of the conference has not been fixed. As the CEO of ISA gave us the timeframe of five weeks, I noticed that there are at some dates conflicts with other events or situations which have to be taken into consideration. Considering all factors the third week would be the best option for this year's conference.  What do you think about these aspects?  And do you have a proposal mentioned the presentation tasks and the sponsor selection? Best regards, Alex
Hello Alex & it is very nice to meet you! I am very excited about the conference and I really hope our team will win and make a perfect impression. A brief introduction about myself: I have joined ISA in 2010 in the context of a student internship at one of the business partners of ISA. After my internship I cooperated with many business contacts of ISA and organized internships for other students. Therefore throughout this years I have gained a profound knowledge about business contacts, their interests and in general how the system at ISA works. I have also participated to a lot of ISA events and talked to the guests about their opinions on our events in general and I have also gained some input from the business contacts.   I was really happy to see that we have similar opinions to some extent so I will start with the points you have already mentioned in your offer I find your proposal about the date for the conference a very good one. Week 3 does not collide with any other events and is still weeks away from Christmas, so the guests will not be in a holiday mood and caught up in family events. About the catering: I agree that a three course meal might be considered by some guests a little formal but we must not forget, that it is also the 40th aniversary of ISA and not only the opening of a new Russian susidiary. My concern is that a buffet is not up to the standards of the event, since our guests are very important people from the business world and also academicians and university professors. I have done some thinking and came up with an idea I would like to propose to you:How do you feel about local Russian cuisine for the catering? I find it very suitable for our event, since we are in Russia and the guests would feel that we really appreciate their culture and for our international guests it would also be a great choice, because they would get to know a little more the Russian culture. Concerning the music act I agree that a very well known DJ will attract many guests but donï¿½t you think it will overshadow the reputation of ISA and that people will be more interested in the music act than the event itself? If we go with the traditional Russian cuisine, it would be extremely aproapriate to also have a local Russian band to create an even more familiar atmosphere for our guests and offer the international guests another piece of the Russian culture.   Now this would be my proposal for the presentation and sponsor: For the presentation I find it a bad idea to hire a third person to do it since it would overshadow us both as organizers. I find it only fair if we would share the presentation. I know it would be a little more difficult to coordinate, but we would both have the same chance at interacting with the audience. And since the two parts are not equally important, we would get to share them and we would both get to do a part of the opening speech and awarding the winners. I also think it is an innovative idea which the audience will enjoy.  Finally we come to the sponsor selection. You already know that Art Inc. made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event. This is a very satisfactory offer, but wouldnï¿½t it be a much better also to ensure the sponsoring of future ISA events by choosing as sponsor Boomerang? I think this would also very much please our jury. As you know Boomerang offers a little less money than Art Inc. but will commit to sponsor many other future events for ISA.   How do you feel about my offer? I am looking forward to hearing from you! Best regards, Chris    
Hello Alex, thank you for your fast answer. I'm also very happy, that we found the date for the conference. But there are some points I don't agree with.  For the Catering: I have to agree that this could be suitable for the event since we are in Russia, but don't you think, that many of the guest are unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, and that it would be smarter to have a mixture where everybody is able to find something they like? I just can't imagine local specialities working for such a multi-cultural event. But with the international buffett we can offer both, the interculteral mixture can include some local russian cuisine and everyone is able to find something (s)he likes and is able to get to know a little more the russian culture. I'm understanding your concerning. But a local band doesn't fit the caracter of an international association's meeting. I thought about a third alternative: How do you think about the pop band FreeLife. They aren't as famous as DJ Happy and don't overshadow the reputation of ISA. They fit much better to the caracter of an international association's meeting, that the local russian group. I have to agree that hiring a third person is a bad idea as sharing this activities.  In my opinion only one of us should do the opening speech and the other one should do the announcing of the awards winner.  Sharing requieres a high coordination, but also much weaker impact for us both. I suggest holding the opening speech by me. As this I would have the possibility to  address many important aspects od the future development of ISA. I have to agree that Boonerang is a good choice, but I'm worried that we can lost Art Inc. as sponsor if we are selecting Boomerang which is a direct compitor of them. Art Inc. have supported the ISA for a long time and I'm sure that their support will continue in the future. But selecting Boomerang is a good reason to change their thinking about supporting us. But it seems that we both think that the other companies aren't interessing and we have to decide between Art Inc. and Boomerang.   Best regards, Alex
Hello Chris!   About the music act and catering: How do you feel about making a compromise between our two ideas and combine them? Letï¿½s do local Russian cuisine and have the band FreeLive performing. I am strongly convinced that this choice combines very good our ideas and visions and it will be very successfull with our guests. The local Russian cuisine will show our appreciation of the local culture and the band will bring a modern and international air to the evening. I am sure our local and international guests will be very confortable with this mixture.     About the sponsor selection: Until now Art Inc. donated money every now and then without having a written contract. This is a good strategy for them, as they donate more money for important events and we often had to struggle to find money for other kinds of events. With Art Inc. we just donï¿½t have the certainty that they will sponsor any other events of ISA. What is the guarantee that they will not chage their mind after sponsoring this event? With Boomerang we get to sign a contract and the next years ISA will be financially secured. With them we will have money to organize all our next events and not just some of the big important ones.     The presentation tasks: I am happy you are also not considering a third person to do it but I also cannot agree that you give the speech and I do the awards since I donï¿½t know what qualifies you for this position more than me. I also can talk about the future development of ISA and the history of the organization. I have experience with public speeches in school and university where I was head of the studentï¿½s council for two years. I also have a deep understanding of the business contacts and their interests and how the internships are organized, so I can easily answer any question from the audience. I sent you the proposal of shared activities because I really believe itï¿½s a good choiche that will put us both in a good light and is also something new that it is not made at every event. I strongly believe that we can cooperate and do a good impression. But if you think it is not suitable for this event I then also nominate myself for doing the speech and you doing the awards. I am still open for discussions regarding this topic if you also are considering different ideas for catering and sponsoring. I am sure we can reach an agreement which we both think will make our event very successful.   This is my offer, tell me what you think about it.   Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris,     Excuse my late answer, but I had to do many university stuff the last hours.   I'm still thinking, that the local Russian cuisine is not the best choice for this event. Why do you think an international buffet which combines a mixture where everybody is able to find something they like, is a bad idea? We have an international event with international guests. Everyone has its own fondness of eating. Won't it be better for our guests if they could choose on their own? They could try not only the local Russian cuisine, but also the things they know and like. But I'm glad, that we agreed both on FreeLife as music act. On your points depending Boomerang and Art Inc. I had to agree and see that it's better if we could plan long term in our sponsors. Maybe your right, and you should be the one who give the opening speech and Iï¿½m the one who do the award. As is written by you, youï¿½re the one who had more experience. But I have a request: If you give the speech, can you introduce me to some of your business contacts? That would be another possibility for me to make the acquaintance of some new business contacts. And please think about the catering. Maybe we should have a closer look to the international three course meal if we canï¿½t find agreement between the international buffet and the local Russian cuisine?   Best regards, Alex
Hi Alex!   I am very happy that we have come to an agreement about 4 of the 5 points and of course I will introduce you to all of my contacts, donï¿½t worry. I have already checked and I know most of the international participants, as I have arranged internships with ISA members for their companies so it wonï¿½t be a problem.   Regarding the food I must say you are right and international food offers more variety and we can be sure that every person will find something to eat. I still cannot accept the buffet because we are planning not only the opening of a new subsidiary but the 40th anniversary of ISA. My concern is that the buffet is to informal for such a big event. There are important people coming and because I know the majority of guests I can say for sure that they expect a certain level of formality and a buffet is also a decline from the conferences over the last few years. However you are right and the international three course meal combines very good both my point of view as well as yours. So how about we choose the international three course meal for the catering? I think it is the perfect sollution for our concept.   Looking forward to hearing from you, best regards, Chris
Hi Chris, Iï¿½m also very happy that we accommodated about 4 of 5 points and worked as a team. The last few days we have made many good compromises and nearly reached our goal. Your arguments for the sponsor selection and the presentation tasks were quite good and I was ready to accept your proposals. Although this time, regarding the three course meal, I think I can persuade you to choose the buffet with the following arguments: From my point of view a three course meal is completely against the initial vision of the event. The idea was to have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances. ISA wanted to bring students and business partners together. How could they mingle and get to know many contacts when they have to sit well-behaved and in a very formal way? If everyone sits beside his desk for several hours with the same people and isnï¿½t able to move freely around, this does not suit the needs of the event. Additionally, there is a possibility that there are guests who are seated side by side that donï¿½t like each other. Then the event would not be a success for both of them. If they had to sit together for a long time that would lead to an awkward atmosphere. Therefore I hope you respect my offer. Best Regards, Alex
Dear Alex,   so as you I found our cooperation very good and productive and I am happy with our outcome. I now accept the international buffet because I can understand your point of view and I believe you are right.   It was nice negotiating with you and I am sure we will win the competition and organize the event!   All the best, Chris
  Dear Chris,   I am pleased to plan the upcoming 40th anniversary of the International Student Association with you! This is a great opportunity for the ISA to expand into a country which is left as a blank spot on the map for our organization. A succeeding anniversary organized by us would be an important step as well for the ISA as for us. There are some important elements of the anniversary we have to find a good agreement on. I'd like to be straight forward and to present you my suggestions:   Regarding date, I plead for Date of Conference: Week 3  which is not to close to Christmas holidays and has no overlaps with other important events according to my information. Regarding catering, I think that an Catering: International buffet  would be most appropiate. It is preferable to a meal with several courses since the aim of the anniversary is to meet many people, which can be achived offering a buffet. ï¿½Internationalï¿½ of course implies that local Russian food should also be included. For entertainment I purpose hiring Music Act: DJ Happy . I am sure we both approve this great artist. Important elements of the event will be speeches will be the speeches and the awards for deserved members. We schould share those activities Presentation Tasks: Shared activities . Last but not least we have to choose a sponsor for this quite expensive event. I suggest Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  as the made the highest offer.   We should always remember that we have only a chance in this competion if we arrange agreement wich is fair for us both.   Best regards,   Alex    
Dear Alex,   Thank you for contacting me, Iï¿½m also looking forward to work with you and Iï¿½m sure weï¿½ll be able to reach the best possible result for both of us. I also want to thank you for creating a first overall plan, I think youï¿½ve did a pretty good job there, although I think we have to tune some details to make it perfect. Iï¿½m already working for ISA for some years and got a good amount of experience in organising such events. As youï¿½ve already mentioned, Russia was a blank spot on the map for ISA till now and thatï¿½s why I think it will be really important to show appreciation to our new Russian members. So letï¿½s have a look to the key points:  I think youï¿½re totally right with the third week, great job there! Regarding the catering I think we should start there to show appreciation for our Russian members and donï¿½t just include their culture in an international buffet. Also I think as this event is the 40th anniversary of our Student Association we should organise things a bit more formal, therefore I would hardly suggest to offer a local Russian cuisine.  As we donï¿½t only want to organise the event in the best possible way, but also want to present our team as good as possible, I think we should choose Boomerang as the main sponsor. Youï¿½re right, Art Inc. offered slightly more money, but I think it shows our positive engagement for ISA even more if we go for Boomerang, as they offered to sign a long term contract, and not only support this one event, but also upcoming events. Regarding the opening ceremony I think we should try to present ourselves as good as possible and not just share the activities, so I would suggest that, Iï¿½ll do the opening Speech and youï¿½ll do the highlight of the evening, the Awards Ceremony. Last but not least I have to say, youï¿½re right, DJ Happy is a really great act and Iï¿½m a bit honoured, that he would be willing to be at our event, but I have the small fear, that he would overshadow the Anniversary a bit. So I think a save choice would be to hire a Local Russian band to show appreciation for our new members culture again.   Iï¿½m looking forward to your reply! Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris,   I am pleased that we agree on Date of Conference: Week 3  as the date of the 40th anniversary! We can consider this as settled.   I also read your counteroffer eagerly, but cannot accept it before some reassambling:   One major point of differing views is the balance local culture ï¿½ international culture, which consists two of four remaining points to bargain. Whereas presenting russian culture to the international audience is certainly very important, I do not think that the cultural offerings should turn entirely russian. I propose that a good mixture should be offered consisting of an Catering: International buffet , and an outstanding outstanding Music Act: Local Russian band . I suggest an international buffet, because differences in culinary culture are immense among the international audience, and people not familiar with the russian cousine should be introduced carefully to the local cousine. Additionally offering a buffet one can better adapt to people who vegetarians/vegans or comply religious rules regarding food. For the other part I can image to concede and agree to hire a russian band. It is appealing to present a new music experience to the audience which also represents Russia adequate! Concerning sponsor selection: I have to remark that Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  - although they do not offer a long term contract ï¿½ are long term partners of ISA who have supported our organization very well in the last years. Choosing their direct rivals of Boomerang would not be greeted. Therefore we should not act impetuous here. Finally talking about presentation activities I have to remark that I am very interested in giving a speech which deals with important topics regarding the ISA. Therefore I really claim having some part or the whole opening speech, which is more important for me than the highlight.  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   I think that we are on a good way to a compromise which fits as most as possible to our ideas how to organize of the 40th anniversary as well es to a superior concept we can hand in!   I'm looking forward to your reply   Best regards,     Alex
Dear Alex, Yes we can consider Date of Conference: Week 3  as fixed, I also agree on Music Act: Local Russian band. I really do understand that you want to hold the opening speech, as this is a really great opportunity to present yourself to the ISA and I trust you that you will prepare very well and give a great opening speech. So Iï¿½m willing to accept Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris and would settle for just doing the awards, if you're willing to accomodate me with the two left points to decide upon. I really want to point the additional benefits of the willingness of Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  to sign a long term contract out again, which will show the important members of ISA how much we care and that we are trying our best to bring as much stability as possible into the financial situation of ISA. And I think I don't have to remind you, that the attempt to establish an office in Moscow allready failed once due to problems in the preperation, so it's of great importance to me, that we don't make similar mistakes! A buffet really isn't suitable for such a big formal event where we want to representate ISA as good as possible, it would fit way better at a small celebration at a local ISA office! And as Russia is a country that`s really proud of it's own culture and history I think we really should appreciate that and offer a Catering: local Russian cuisine.  I have to agree I feel like we could present the best overall concept as soon as we'll come to an agreement. I'm looking forward to your reply and your ideas! Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris,   As the Date of Conference: Week 3  , the Music Act: Local Russian band   and the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   are fixed, we have to quickly consider the remaining two.   As we do not have much time left, I suggest following deal: I would like to accept Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   as sponsor if we dismiss local rusian cousine as catering with finality. While switching sponsors (Art. Inc. will not be amused!) can be justified with free market behavior and will not be taken personal by any side, I have serious doubts about offering russian cousine only! As I already said it would not fit to the tastes and cultural habits of too many among the audience. I am sure that choosing a outstanding local band represents russian culture sufficiently. As a compromise, I offer that a Catering: International three course meal will be offered, containing one russian meal which is too exotic for guests from cultures which are very different from the russian.   Since I consider this offered compromise as a large concession made by my side, I will not be going to accept local cousine only.   I am confident that we can finally agree to a concept which fits to our perceptions as most as possible.   I'm looking forward to your reply.   Kind regards,     Alex
Hi Alex, I think we've found a good compromise that we can turn in to ISA. I accept your offer, Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris,  As you know we are in the same team to organize this great event.  I have already thought some issues we have talk about together.  First of all I was looking at possible sponsors, and I believe that Art Inc would be a very interesting and reasonable choice. Furthermore, concerning the date of the event, It would be better on  third week. We will talk further about other possible changes. I am looking forward to your answer. Best Regards, Alex    Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Date of Conference: Week 3  
Dear Alex, thank you for your initial offer. Sadly I have some issues with some of your proposed selections. Week 3 is for me not that great for personal reasons, I would need to reschedule my appointments, but I am willing to do so as I know that you have made great research for this particular case. So I will cancel my appointment now, so we can have the date decided by you. Thanks for the research again. As for the Sponsor Selection I have done a huge amount of research and came to the conclusion that it would suit ISA best for future events if you choose Boomerang as it is the best option in the long run. Let me explain. First of all Boomerang will grant us a long term contract which gives us a financial security for all upcoming events and to ISA itself to some extent. In the short term we will have only slightly less, but ISA was always about long term perspectives and Dr Illenschitz would be very thankfull to us both if we establish something really big and lasting for russian future with ISA. With Art Inc. it would be more of a gamble as they might dislike our event and jump off future contracts. Additionally we might establish multiple contracts for future events which would be even better. So I makes sense for the both of us if we choose Boomerang. For the opening speech (presentaion talks) I would like to give you the upper hand by giving you the awards ceremony which has had huge impacts in the past for ISA Events. In exchange I would take the opening ceremony. For the previous commitment I would like to propose the local russian cuisine. I have done a lot of research on that topic and established several requirements to ensure the best local experience. From several russian friends I know that culture is very important in russia and needs to be addressed very carefully as you know it is really important. Also russians tend to dislike anything that is international (mostly translated as american). So for that reason its better not to mess with the russians, as everybody knows you should not mess with russians and stay true to their very important culture. I wish you a nice day and look forward to hearing from you, with my best regards, Chris
Dear Chris,  thank you for your answer and offer.  I also have some issues with your proposed selections that we can discusse together.  First of all, I assure you that I have made  a really careful research and I found out that the third week Is actually the best option because in some dates there are  other events and very important people won't be able to join and their presence is very important, and the last two dates are very close to Christmas so most of people won't be able to come. ( I have already done researches also in that way). Thank you for reschedule your appointment.  Furthermore, talking about the sponsor: on the one hand I think that  because of ISA's  longterm relationship with Art Inc It would be the best choice. They have always supported  the association and they would keep on in this direction. On the other hand, choosing Boomerang can open a new chapter in ISA and it would be also positive because It would seems a change and in my opinion Dr Illenschitz would appreciate it, since that is what he asks for. Regarding the catering,after a specific research I agree with you about the importance of traditions for russian people, and we have to be really careful in order to respect them. Otherwise it would be a failure like the last time. However, since not all guests are russian and most of them will be unfamiliar with russian food, I think that a reasonable solution, in order to satisfy both russian guests and international guests, would be an international buffet. We absolutely don't want people to be disappointed about the catering and this will be a perfect solution. Regarding the opening speech, thank you for your offer. But since you have rescheduled all your programs for the third week, as I propose, and since I also know that has great impact in ISA events,  let me return you the favour  by giving you the awards ceremony. I would take with pleasure the opening ceremony. In the end, I would like to talk about the music act. After a research I conclude that Dj Happy would be a good choice. His a very famous performer and this would attract many guests and would also increase  ISA's visibility . I wish you a nice day and I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Alex   Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang        
Dear Alex, thank you for your understading and the open discussion about the issues we face. As you stated previously it is very important that we satisfy both of our guests, international and local russian people. I agree with you on that part and, because of that I would like to obligate and offer a healthy mixture so we can satisfy both parties. I am going to accept DJ Happy for the internatiol guests to have a great party, and we may show our respect for the russian people by serving them local russian food. That seems to be a good combination for the wellbeeing of several kinds of guests. You pointed out that you are willing to give me the honor of the award givings, but I am not really interested in doing that, so this sadly would not do any favor to me, and would not appreciate my personal loss over the date of conference. I would rather prefer a compensation for my loss of any other kind. That would be for instance having FreeLife instead of DJ Happy as I am a little bit worried about the popularity of DJ Happy. He is really very popular and I guess it would be a little distracting for the event to have such a big name here. I don't want people to attend our event for the DJ and rather focus on the event itself. Let me also note that I am still in favor of a more local event (local cuisine, local band), focusing on the russians, becuase they are the ones we want to win over, so please understand that again I would be rather unhappy with the current music act choice, but its the most berable for me if I really have to take that. Have a great evening Alex, with my best regards - Chris
Dear Chris, Thank you for your answer. Sadly there are some issues that we still have to talk about, but I'm sure we will reach a good solution. I can accept Freelife for the music act and Boomerang as Sponsor but I insist on the international buffet because is the best diplomatic solution. We can introduce more russian meals than international meals and much people will be satisfied. Have a great evening too. Best Regards,  Alex  
Dear Alex, what you just did I cannot understand. First of all you changed the Presentation Tasks back although it seemed to me that you would accept my offer on that, you also did not mention that issue? So you seem to be forcing this one on me? I though that I am doing you a favor here, so I'll assume you changed it back so I would rather accept an international music act as well as catering. I was pretty confident about my fair proposition to split this up to have a good deal. You also did not mention my compensation for the date of conference. How much do you like the international three course meal, because I think that would be more suitable for our international guests, that I would count as a small, but nontheless, compensation. If the international buffet is of such a great importance to you I might again obligate to your needs again, but then I would insist on you accepting the music act. Also I did not know that you were not happy about our Boomerang decision, because you made it clear that you also prefer Bommerang because its better long term and you said yourself it is better for us infront of Dr Illenschitz. Then I would also insist on you doing the awards. Note that as of the current deal state I am already suffering a lot and I am also below my own expectations. Best regards - Chris
Dear Chris,  According to your last answer, this could be a good solution: I accept Freelife in the music act and Boomerang as sponsor as you want  but I insist on the international buffet as Catering. (I've just thought that Art Inc would be the best choice but I can accept also Boomerang.) We mantain the date on the third week. Last thing we have to check is the presentation tasks. I will accept to do the awards presentation and give to you the speech.  Tell me what do you think about this offer. Have a nice day. Best Regards, Alex
Dear Alex, thank you for your counteroffer, but you still seem to ignore your own proposition 3 messages ago, which stated that we mix Catering and the music act international and local. Sadly I see the catering as a very serious thing as you, so that it is only possible for me to accept this damaging deal if we do it as you proposed 3 messages ago, by having the local band and the international meal. The catering seems to be very important for both of us, and I am only willing to give it up if you you can grant me the music act, which is not such a huge deal as catering, but I would accept the suffering from my side just to have some kind of deal. There I only rather accept the 3 course meal which is more balanced in my opinion, which was also an offer by you. Additionally I can propose you do local catering and DJ Happy music act. Also you agreed with me some messages ago that Boomerang is clearly the better option, so I dont understand why you again shifted towards the opposite opinion. Would that make a fair deal to you? From my point of view we are already favoring mostly your propositions for the really important stuff (date of conference and catering). Alle the other deals are pretty bad from my point of view as I think that stying local is more important to russia than satisfying international guests, as we want to primarely focus on winning the russians over). To do so we absoluty need as much local stuff as possible. It is pretty difficult for me to make a deal that is worse than my current offer. Please also try to understand my point of view, together we are trying to organize a fine event for our guests. Best regards - Chris
Dear Chris,  I still have questions on some of your positions. Two messages ago, you told me that you were able to accept the international buffet as catering choice but you would insist on the music act. You also told me that Freelife was a good choice for you and therefore I accept your choice about the music. Now you are arguing about both. Before the last message, you didn't mention anything about the local music but only about free Life so I thought we have a solution concerning the music act. What I told about the sponsor was that although for me ART Inc is best, I can accept Boomerang as an option ans as a sponsor. And that's why I accept your propose of the sponsor, for me that is not shift toward the opposite opinion. Therefore, in my opinion as you said before if you can grant me the catering I will let you decide about the music act. I know that the most important thing is to satisfy locals, but It's not possible to focus our attention only on them leaving internationals unsatisfied. That would be a bad move.  Tell me what you decide about the music act, because I believe that if your are really sure on local band or freelife, means that you have done great researches about it. We have to organize a great event together so we have to find the best solution.  Looking forward to your answer. Best Regards,  Alex   Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  
Dear Alex, thank you for your appreciation about my loss over the date of conference and the difficult but important catering discussion as it is for the both of us a big deal. I would still prefer to take the catering instead of the local band but lets agree on that, because you seem to be slightly unhappy about our sponsor selection. I am not that happy about this little amount of local stuff for our guests but as we both already took big hits, as you aim to satisfy our international guests. I still dont agree with you on that, but for the sake of a great and mixed event and possible relationship between the both of us I would accept the deal as it is of now. I would be way more happy with the international three course meal, beacause it would be a better (more balanced) compromise. For the date of conference I am not very satisfied as it was important for me, but I already gave it to you at the beginning. Best regards - Chris
Dear Chris,  I feel that you are slightly un happy about the catering and since I notice that is also very important for you and that we both took big hits, I can accept international three course meal for the catering. I think that we are planning together the event and we have to do it in the best way in order to be both satisfied and reach a good compromise. Best Regards, Alex   
Dear Alex, thank you very much for your kind offer, I feel like we could make a great team and the event is going to be very nice thanks to our great organization. I hope this level of locality is sufficient and we also have a nice catering for our international guests. Thank you again and see you on the event. Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I'm getting in touch with you concerning the ISA event we have to organize together. I would like you to take this offer in consideration. I'm looking forward having your ideas. Best regards, Alex
  Dear Alex,     Thank you for your message! I regret to tell you that our conceptions differ, albeit slightly.     I am fully aware of divergent perspectives in bargaining settings which is why I personally would like to hereby reassure you that I regard our whole liaison from a cooperative, collaborative point. For it takes two to do so, though, I indeed hope we both can agree on such a partner-like fair team play that we both can make the best of the situation mutually (!). In my opinion, therefore, we're on a good way to find a solution that will suit both of us.     In response to your suggestions, please find attached my proposed terms, very carefully considered.   I am looking forward to a good phase of new collaboration and I am tautly awaiting your reverse offer.     Cordially   Chris  
Hello Chris, Thank you for your quick answer. Though your offer is really attractive, I send you this counter offer. Below are the changes I've done :  - Music Act : What about inviting the FreeLife band to our event? - Catering : Would you consider an international three course meal ? Best regards, Alex      
Dear Alex, The concessions of your last offer showed me that we are on the right way to a successful cooperation on this forthcoming event. Nevertheless, I cannot completely accept the conditions that you have proposed and would like to renegotiate certain issues, in particular music act. I also want to show my goodwill, therefore see my accommodations in this offer. -We have already widely agreed on presentation tasks, sponsor selection and the date of conference and I hope we can keep that. -As regards music act, I had to readapt it. I ascribe top priority to it. I perceive giving a local Russian band a favor reflects our recognition of the Russian culture of your host. That is to say, mutual estimation is a fundamental principle to me, making an international band pretty much a no-go. Lowering it would decline my utility notably. -Concerning catering, I take up the position as for music act. However, at the bottom, I am open to a concession in that respect for the moment, provided other terms are acceptable to you. I have altered my selection accordingly and propose to simply explore where it steers us to. I wish you a nice day and am looking forward to your reactions. Best regards Chris
Dear Chris,  Please, find below the new proposal. I can make a concession on the local Russian band but I must insist on the International Buffet. Let's make both our Russian hosts and international guests happy! I'm leaving tomorrow night and I won't be able to answer you on Friday. Let me know if this offer doesn't suit you.  Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Weï¿½ve got a deal! Signed Alex
  Dear Chris, my name is Alex and together we are forming a team, to organize a concept for the event of ISAï¿½s 40th anniversary and the newly established subsidiary in Saint Petersburg. I already have some concepts concerning the atmosphere of the event, but I am also very excited to hear about your ideas. One of the most important issues we need to discuss is the selection of  our sponsor. There have been a few companies that contacted us, but after analyzing each offer carefully  I am very certain, that we should stick to Art Inc. Not only did they make the best offer for this event by far, but they have also been a supporter of ISA for a very long time. In order to support this long-lasting business relationship and to continue it in the future, we should choose Art Inc. as our sponsoring partner. Another important aspect we should discuss is the catering. As ISA is an international Student Association it brings together people from all over the world with different tastes and different preferences. Therefore I think it would be a great idea to offer an international buffet with specialities from all over the world, so everyone can find something he likes. Additionally a buffet creates a relaxed and easy-going, small-talk creating atmosphere, where people can grab something to eat and talk to different people. Enclosed you can find my first ideas listed. Of course they are all to discuss. I believe with both of our inputs and combined efforts, this is going to be a great event! I am looking forward to working with you. Hope to hear from you soon. Kind regards, Alex  
Dear Alex, Thank you very much for contacting me regarding the ISA's upcoming anniversary event. I'm very exited to have the opportunity to organize this event jointly with you. I've also made some considerations with respect to the event's theme and some other aspects. As for the sponsor: I could not agree more - a good sponsor is beyond any doubt a valuable asset for our event. While I agree that Art Inc has somewhat of a tradition of sponsoring our events, I strongly feel inclined to support Boomerang. Their ongoing support would not only help us to create a truly impressive event this year but would also support us in furthering our progress in the years to come. Regarding the theme of the event: While I agree that the international exchange is one of the strengths of our organization, we could not have become as strong as we are without the individual strengths of our partner countries. And since the event is also the opening for our new subsidiary, i think a slight Russian theme of the event would only be fitting. What do you think? I am very much looking forward to hearing your thoughts on my ideas. Attached please find more details. I am sure that we will be able to create a truly memorable event together. Kind regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, thank you for your considerations. Firstly I would like to sum up the aspects we agree on: -          - I think we can set the date  of the conference in week 3. -          -  Concerning the presentation tasks we both do agree on somehow sharing the activities. But I would rather spilt the presentation into the opening speech as one part, and the awards as the other part. I am afraid it would require a high coordination  to split both speeches into half and  to take them together. Therefore I suggest one of us is doing the opening and the other one the award speech. I would love to give the opening speech if you are ok with giving the award speech. Regarding the theme of the event we  have some different views. I understand your aspects, and I am sure we can talk to the catering service and ask them to integrate some russian specialities into the international buffet as well. I feel like in such an international atmosphere it is very important to offer music and food for the general taste. Of course we can inculde Russian specialities into the buffet, and ask DJ Happy to play some latest Russian music and artists in his program. Would you agree on this compromise? Kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Thank you very much for sharing your ideas. It is great that we agree on the date of the conference. As for the opening speech: I am sure that we will find some sort of arrangement. Since we both seem to be eager to do the opening speech, I would suggest to postpone this decision to a later point, so that we will have the opportunity to use it as a means to ensure that both of us feel equally represented in the organization of this event. However while going through the remaining aspects I realized that there seem to be quite some challenges ahead of us. As for the question of the theme of the congress I would suggest a compromise that would allow both aspects (international flair and local tradition) to be equally present: If we combine an international three course meal with an act of a local band, I think we may have the best aspects of both of our ideas and would generate a truly remarkable expirience for our guests. I however don't think we should strife for a too informal atmosphere of the event. This special occasion (actually both of them) asks for a truly special event and especially with the history of our organization in Russia, I think we should emphasize that our company is really eager to be part of the Russian network. A genuine and festive event will beyond doubt help to communicate that more than an informal buffet. Another topic we should discuss is the choice of sponsor. Since we are in the remarkable position of actually being able to choose between several sponsors, I shared with you my thoughts on picking Boomerang as sponsor during my last mail. Their contract would give us stronger opportunities for ongoing growth and the knowledge that our company will be able to count on another good and solid partnership in the years to come. Unfortunately you did not seem to agree with my ideas - i would be happy to discuss this quiestion with you. Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris,Thank you for your response. I went through the offers of the different sponsors again. I still believe Art Inc to be the better option. But as we need to find an agreement I am willing to let you choose Boomerang as our sponsor, if you in exchange are willing to agree to an international atmosphere. We are a Student Association and really need to stick to our roots and remain to our student clientele concerning the catering. Besides the music act really makes the event top or flop. And I don't believe a local russian band will satisfy the music taste of all our guests. In DJ Happy's music programm we can make sure that different types of music are played and therefore everyone has a great time. Have a nice day. Kind regards, Alex
"Dear Alex, Thank you for kindly considering my counteroffer and valuing my ideas in these matters. Yes I think your proposal is an excellent starting point: I can of course agree to a more international theme with a touch of local atmosphere. Your arguments seem very reasonable. So I would propose either - an international three course meal (the international theme) and a local band or - local cuisine and a international band. I could not agree more with you with regard to the importance of having a good band since it really sets the mood for our visitors. However I would rather suggest FreeLife in this case. DJ Happy is as a brand and thus as an act too famous and thus might overshadow our event. I think ISA should be the most prominent aspect of this evening. I think neither of us wants people to remember the evening as the day they saw DJ Happy on ""an event"". As far as I am concerned I would rather prefer the second option (as currently suggested), but I am of course looking forward to hearing your views on that matter. I am really excitet about the event and about the commitment of our team to ensuring the best outcome for our visitors. A nice day to you as well. Kind regards, Chris"
Dear Chris, I am very happy that we are starting to get to an agreement by sharing our views and adjusting our preferences to each other. I have made a step towards you, by letting you chose Boomerang as our sponsor. As I understand you really hesitate to engage DJHappy for this event. How do you feel about the pop Band Free Life?I really do not see a Local Russian band fitting to this event. Last but not least I have to say that I reallly want to stick to the idea of an international buffet. I just have this great picture in my head where people stand around in small, personal groups doing small-talk and enjoying the buffet. I feel like an international three course meal is just to stringent as everyone strictly sits on his place. I hope you feel comfortable with my offer. Kind regards, Alex
Dear Chris, Thank you for sharing your ideas with me. Although I strongly feel that we should put more emphasis on the local culture I can also understand your arguments. I would be willing to agree to the package as suggested and make to concession of having both relevant program activities without a local influece. However, in this case I really want to be able to make a valuable contribution to the event as well. One possibility would be to hold the speech at the beginning of the event, while you can present the awards. What do you think about this possible solution? Kind regards, Chris
Good morning Chris, I am very happy to see that we are about to find an agreement! I am already very excited for the event. I think we make a great team, and our ideas and concepts complement one another perfectly. As I have mentioned before, I am also very keen on giving the opening speech. As we both really want to open the event, I thought about a fair solution. Why don't we engage an external speaker? This could either be professional host or optionally someone important from the industry- maybe an alumni, who had been part of ISA for a very  long and successful time? I think a third perosn would be very beneficial for the event, and we can both concentrate on the organization of it.   Kind regards, Alex
Dear Chris, Thank you for this idea. I am very happy about the variety of different solutions we are discussing in order to find the perfect solution for our event. However in the case of engaging an external speaker, I am afraid that I can't bring myself to agree to your idea. Both of us contributed greatly to prepare the event and our inspired work should result in us welcoming our participants personally. As mentioned earlier: I am willing to make concessions in our shared effort to create this unique event and happy to agree to an international buffet and FreeLife as a band. However since that means that I won't be able to contribute by adding some local atmosphere to the event, I would like to at least have the possibility to welcome our guests and make sure that our local network is properly introduced and met with a warm and hearty welcome. Having neither the possibility to contribute to the catering and music act, nor to the presentation would make it a bit hard for me to think of this project as our common effort. I hope you can understand my thoughts in this matter and are willing to accommodate me in this regard. Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, I reconsidered your argument, and I agree on your point. You have made a sacrifice  concerning the theme of the event in the catering and music act. Therefore I understand that you insist on the opening speech. I am fine with presenting the awards. I am very happy that this worked out so well and uncomplicated. I really appreciate you as a business partner and team player. I am very excited for the event and hope we will have other projects to work on together. Kind regards, Alex
Hey Chris, We have already setlled some issues for the conference but there are still some aspects about the planning that I would like to discuss with you. So, I send you this e-mail with some propositions about the conference. The first change I propose is the organisation of the music Act. Over the last year, I notice an increasing disatisfaction of the guest to the music acts at the ISA events. I immediately though of DJ Happy, a very famous performer, who would be perfect for this event. Another unresolved issue is the catering. The conference should have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances wich, in my opinion, requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. So, I propose an international buffet.  Currently, the exact date of the conference has not been fixed. Some dates are conflicting with other events. I think that the 3 week would be the best.  Another unresoved aspect regards the presentation task. There are two tasks for this part, so I propose you to share these tasks. What do you think about annoucing the winner of the yearly ISA award and hand out the certificate to the respective person and I will make the opening speech. The last issue is the sponsor selection. Art.inc made the best offer in terms of short term payment directly to the event. Therefore, I propose this sponsor.  Looking forward to hearing from you, Best regards, Alex 
Hey Alex! Thank you for your Mail! So I see we have some different opinions on the theme of the event, but I hope we can figure something out, which fits the both of us. First I think what is very important, because we are launching in a new and very tradtional country, is to show them that we are intersted in their culture and traditions. Therefore I highly suggest to keep things very Russian. For the International guests it fits also, because it is new for them. I think the people will feel most comfortable with this. So I think it would be best to have a  local Russian cusine and a Russian band. For the speech I would like to switch parts, if possible but Iï¿½m probably willing to give in on this, if we keep the event Russian style :) For sponsoring I suggest Boomerang over Art Inc. because Art Inc. is only a one time thing. Boomerang is willing to sign a long term contract with us and I think the ISA would really much appreciate this. About the date I think week 4 fits better, but week 3 is also negotiable. Looking forward to your answer! All the best, Chris  
Hey Chris! Thank you for your very fast answer. We have found an agreement on the sponsor Selection, Boomerang is a good one too and I can make a concession of this. I know that this is a very traditioanl country but if we propose local Russian food, I think nobody will eat. Since many of the guests are probably unfamilliar with the Russian cuisine, I think it would be smartervto have some kind of internatioanal mixture where everybody can find something they like. Regarding the local russian music this is not a bad idea to have a russian atmosphere but I'm afraid that having a local band play for such an event does not fit the character of an international association's meeting.  I can let you making the speech if we choose the 3 week for the date of the conference. Week four would be very close to the Christmas holidays and thus would be doable but really not perfect.  Looking forward to your answer! Your Sincerelly, Alex Looking forward to your answer!
hey Alex! I still feel we need something Russian in the event. The Russian will feel acknowleged and for the foreigners it is very nice to have something different.  Therefore I suggest to have either Russian cuisine or a Russian band. Can we find an agreement on this? All the best,  Chris
Hey Chris, I'm agree to keep one russian thing but I truly think the best is an international buffet and a local russian music for the atmosphere.  Can we find an agreement on this ? Best regards, Alex
Hey Alex! Yes this sounds good! Thank you for being so cooperative! I wish you all the best, Chris
Hello Chris, after those busy days last week, I am happy to get back to you on defining our concept for ISA's annual conference 2016 in St. Petersburg.  Considerung our experience in ISA, I am absolutely certain that we can win this competition as a team and make the event what it deserves to be when we combine our skills in organising such a huge event! I mean - together, we really have the opportunity to leave our mark on this huge anniversary: We simply have to stick to our roots as a student organisation again and do everything in our power in order to excite our potential new members in Russia. Only in that way we can make sure that Russia's best talents will join ISA - and in return, this will be the biggest incentive to engage companies to be our long-term partners. Knowing that collaborating with us means having access to the largest base of talented young academics in the world, lots of Russian companies will intend to collaborate with us. In order to engage both the students and the companies, it is key to provide a program which suits our organisation's base: Our actual and potential student members.  Regarding the catering, the best way to make sure we have a comfortable and appropriate atmosphere for networking is an international buffet. In this way, people are not fixed to the same seats and the same people for the entire meal and we are safe that everyone's taste is met. Moreover, the music is essential for a positive spirit during the event where people dance, talk and have more fun together. That is only possible if we have an internationally popular act like DJ Happy who normally fills entire music halls at his concerts. He would be attracting many young people who would then be interested in ISA as well. In my opinion it is also critical to schedule the event to the right week. Since weeks 4 and 5 - especially week 5 - of our timeframe are already too close to Christmas, there remain just the first three weeks. Week 2 is already occupied with another event where ISA's vice president is needed and the first week is also very inappropriate due to the International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow. Consequently, week 3 fits best to our constraints. Concerning the selection of our main sponsor I think it is obvious that we will stick to our well-known partner Art Inc. that already offered us a huge amount ot direct support for our event. That is great since we have a lot of financial scope in providing an extraordinary program for our participants. At last, I think we need to decide about the role split in doing the presentations at the opening event. For the opening speech it is critical to arrange a decent talk in order to have an approriate kick-off to the event. I'd like to volunteer there as I already gained lots of experience with larger audiences giving lectures and tutorials at my home university. In that way, you will have the opportunity to hold the prestigious award ceremony that everyone has been awaiting for almost one year!   Alright - I am sure that my suggestions are in our mutual interest and we can both get along with this. I just can't wait for the event to start!   All the best, Alex
"Hi Alex, Thank you so much for sending me the concept, good ideas!!. Iï¿½m really excited for this opportunity and as far as I can tell from your e-mail so are you! Iï¿½m glad that we are on the same page, now letï¿½s do this! Iï¿½ll just address your points one by one: The catering: I completely agree that there should be enough room for networking during the conference. But since we have both been to more than one conference we know that networking is mostly conducted in between the talks en after dinner. From personal experience I found that a buffet is often a less official more ï¿½informalï¿½ way to provide food to our guests. Most conferences have a ï¿½gala dinerï¿½ and I wouldnï¿½t want ours to have a buffet since is feels more suited for internal and local ISA events without marketing purposes. In addition, I believe that it is really important that we satisfy our Russian guests and therefore serve Russian cuisine. I totally understand the idea you have behind the international food, however; you donï¿½t go to Italy without tasting itï¿½s famous whines or you donï¿½t go to the Netherlands without tasting ï¿½dropï¿½ etc. With regard to the music act I refer to my arguments above regarding the catering. We both know that the most important thing for this event is to make our office in Russia a success. The rest is simply celebrating. The choice of the location was a deliberate one and I believe we should honor this deliberate choice by honoring the ï¿½guest landï¿½ and inviting a local Russian band. Off course this band should compliment the characteristics of this conference and ISA as an organization.  The sponsoring by Art inc.: that was my first obvious choice as well. However, have you noticed that we do not have a written agreement with Art inc.? Although their sponsoring is the highest for this event, there is nothing being said about the future. Since we are on thin ice here with trying to re-start an office in Russia after it did not work out before I believe that certainty is needed. Boomerang has offered to sign a written agreement about the future. Just think about the long-term plan here: say 40.000 from Art inc. for the event and nothing long-term. Or 25.000 for the event and a long term monthly fee of a couple of thousand would seem more attractive donï¿½t you think? The date of the event is very tricky indeed. I would not mind having the event in week three, although week four has my preference. We can always work this out. And finally, the speech. To be honest I am more of a background person and I have always been more concerned about the organization ï¿½back stageï¿½. However, we both know what a great deal it is to present the opening speech. Since my priority is the event and I agree with you that you have more experience with larger audiences I believe that you would be better suited to do the opening speech and I simply present the awards. However, this is with the best interest of the conference in mind since I know that I would gain more personally if I presented the speech. So I hope you appreciate this gesture and also take into account the overall event when considering my other options. Okay, so let me know how you feel about this. I am also so excited! Talk to you soon!  Chris"
"Hi Chris, first of all, thanks a lot for your message - I can really sense your enthusiasm for organising a great conference and I am happy to say that it was good to be matched together as one team although we have not known each other before. I think we are on the right track! Let me respond to your comments on the concept details one after anthother. When it comes to the selection of the catering and a music act, we can really define the orientation of the entire event, so we have to be cautious there. I can absolutely see your point about making sure we provide ISA with a fresh start in the new office in Russia. However, we have to keep in mind that this is still the Annual Conference of ISA which provides the event with a general frame. What is even more important to the event is the fact that it marks our 40th anniversary - we will celebrate four decades of a successful International Student Association! Don't you think this is an amazing reason to celebrate and honor our success as an internationally growing association run by students? Isn't that the reason why we such a huge attention of companies that want to work with us? Because they know that only with us they are able to reach such a large audience of 30.000 internationally-oriented talents from 20 different countries all over the planet. This unique international spirit is a core value that on the one hand, we have to show to local russian companies looking for potential employees from modern nations. And on the other hand, we convince many new student members who are attracted by multinational companies to ISA by making the value of internationality visible. At last, I think you know exactly how important it is for the students that there need for decent food is satisfied - something we can only make sure with an international buffet which addresses all the long-term ISA members travelling to St. Petersburg from all over the world. Or do you think most of the people will like russian ""Borsch"" soup? Unfortunately, Russia is not as famous for it's cuisine as Italy or France.    Nonetheless, this is certainly not a usual annual conference since we also celebrate our newly-opened Russian office. In order to meet you with regard to your expectations on the music act, I suggest we book a local Russian band in order to give the event frame of the annual conference an suitable touch of ISA's new branch's home country. I hope you can appreciate this concession of mine as I want the event to be in both of our interests.   With regard to the selection of our sponsor we need to think about the effects this decision would have on the professional image our stakeholders connect with us. You are particularly right when looking at the different payments Art Inc. and Boomerang offer us. Considering this in a financial manner, I would clearly agree with you: 25.000 plus a monthly fee is superior to a one-time payment of 40.000. But first - are you 100% certain about these figures and do you know the exact amount of Boomerang's long-term payment? As I'm saying, I would agree with you on a financial basis. However, this is not simply a fincancial decision. It is an issue where we have to take into account the status and experiences with the respective sponsors. Even if Art Inc. didn't include a specific long-term payment into their offer, the relationship between them and ISA is already built on a fruitful long-term support. This is a partner we know, we can already count on at present and we will be able to count on in the future. Offering us this huge amount of 40.000 for the event is already a clear signal. Or do you think they would invest in ISA for several years now and simply stop after the event? The only reason them to do that would be an engagement of their direct competitor Boomerang at our event. Giving up a long-term supporting partner for an unknown company that offers us lots of money - do you think that would be a good signal on our image in public and for other companies interested in ISA? For me, there is nothing better than a functioning relationship. Please, let's not focus too much on money and think about indirect effects. Only then, we can have a proper decision.    As you stated - the date of the conference is very tricky indeed. I am glad that we share the opinion that the third week will be best.   I can completely assure you that the success of our event is my first interest. That is why I highly appreciate your gesture to split the presentation tasks as suggested. Of course, I did that having in mind our different characters and preferences.   I am really excited about the development of our concept and I feel that it goes in the right direction! Please let me know as soon as possible what you think about my comments. Kind regards, Alex "
"Dear Alex, We are absolutely on the right track! Thank you for explaining everything in detail and understanding where I am coming from. I think we are both on the winning team ;)! In my opinion we are almost done with making the ï¿½hardï¿½ decisions and we are definitely going to have an exquisite event. With regards to the catering; I can definitely see your point here. We have to look beyond pleasing the local office and to be honest, the thought of eating Russian cuisine does not really attract me either. And since were both also a part of the ï¿½target groupï¿½ I can imagine that I wouldnï¿½t be the only one to dislike the idea of eating Russian food. So, lets go international to be safe and to please everyone that is attending, we have already ï¿½pleasedï¿½ the locals by the music choice which is a more neutral manner to say ï¿½we appreciate the Russian cultureï¿½. However, I do believe that a buffet is so ï¿½informalï¿½ and not as high class as we would like to present ourselves. We want to have a great festivity and rewarding our guests with a three-course meal seems more appropriate. I have never been to a conference where there is a buffet at the actual party. The buffets were rather used for breakfast or lunch. Imagine everyone sitting at their tables, have the waiters bring their food telling each table what is served, everybody eating at the same time etc.: very high class. To recap: I totally agree on the international part since your arguments are indisputable however I would prefer a international three-course meal to ensure a real high class ï¿½galaï¿½ diner. Further, it seems that we have come to a decision on the music act, the date and the presentation tasks. The only thing that is left for me to discuss is the sponsor. Iï¿½ve taking your arguments into consideration and I can see that is more than a plain financial situation here. Although it is a business world and if the sponsoring would be more low key I would definitely choose Boomerang. However I can relate with your following remark: ï¿½Giving up a long-term supporting partner for an unknown company that offers us lots of money - do you think that would be a good signal on our image in public and for other companies interested in ISA?ï¿½. We want to come across as a reliable company and we want to show that we are loyal to our long term partners. Therefore, I agree with you that we should go with Art Inc. as our sponsor.  So, since the deadline is approaching, I hope that we have figured everything out. I believe that we will have a great event!! Have a nice day.   Kind regards, Chris"
"Chris, alright, I guess we are almost done finalising our concept and I am thrilled about what we already achieved in our discussions. I cannot imagine how we are not going to win the competition with this concept! Thanks for meeting me in the selection of a sponsor and also for appreciating my agreement on your suggestion to include a local russian band - it was hard to sacrifice having an international DJ or at least a well-known band as our music act. I think it is great that we are on the same page in having an internationally-oriented conference. However, to be very honest with you: I actually expected that - in turn to my gesture regarding the music act - you would be accepting my suggestion about providing an international buffet. Yet, I can really see your point and completely agree with you that we also have to arrange a formal atmosphere at our event. The thing is that the catering decision against a buffet and for a three course meal is not the right way to address the need to set a formal frame. The conference as the opening of the St. Petersburg office is really crucial to start ISA's business in Russia. Therefore, it is our job to set the first spark to a fruitful future to our Russian business. That is why we need to provide an appropriate frame where Russian business representatives have the opportunity to get in touch with as many international ISA members as possible in order to convince them of our high member quality and start a partnership with us. Don't you think a three course meal where everyone sits at their same seats for a few hours bears an enormous risk of inhibiting exactly what we want to activate? Arranging an international buffet would make sure that people are able to walk around during the dinner, feel free to approach each other very comfortably and have many opportunities to enlarge their networks. I really hope you can follow me and understand why it is so important for me to insist on the catering selection. However, I am not at all interested in undermining your preferences. Therefore, I thought of another way to guarantee a formal atmosphere at our ""gala"" event. As the ""black tie"" dresscode at these annual conferences already sets the perfect ground for the intended ambience, I suggest we combine this with a very formal way of the presentations. Why don't we hire an external speaker? Like that we would have someone important talking about the importance of the ISA for the business world. Having a third person for the opening speech instead of an ISA member would make the atmosphere a lot more formal.  I hope you can see how important it is to me, that you are also happy with our concept. That is why I am also very open to other suggestions regarding the decision about the presentation tasks.  Yet, I consider it a great achievement that we were able to settle an agreement on the music act, the sponsor selection and the date of the conference. I am confident that we can come together on the remaining two issues as we are approaching the deadline. Irrespecive of all the decisions, we will make a great team to win the competition and start the actual organisation of the conference! Have a great day, too! All the best, Alex"
Dear Alex, We are almost there, however, I see some changes in the Presentation Task, although we had already discussed this point, and to my knowledge, finalized it. In my opinion this is not acceptable since we both already agreed on this point and changing it at the last moment feels a bit tricky. In addition, hiring a third person takes away both of our opportunities to gain personally from this event. Therefore, the only two matters that were still open were the catering and the sponsoring. I agreed to go your way with the sponsoring. This only leaves the catering. I can see that you find the international buffet very important. You want the people to be free to network and socialize. Since an international three-course meal as a compromise for both of us I believed this to be a nice option. Although I still believe this is the best option, I do understand were you are coming from with the buffet and the dress-code will make the diner more formal.  Thank you for working together so far. Letï¿½s enjoy the event!   Greetings, Chris
Chris, at first I want to thank you for meeting me with regard to the catering decision, I appreciate that. As you stated correctly, the international three course meal would have been a compromise for both of us, and - in this case - an inacceptable compromise since it would have risked the essential purpose of our event of creating an effective ground for networking between ISA members and businesses. So thanks again for understanding that the buffet will fit best to this purpose. As a fair exchange for insisting on the catering option it was my intention to offer you a reasonable alternative regarding another way to assure a formal atmosphere to the event. As the conference's outcome is my first interest, I offered you to step back regarding the presentation tasks. In my opinion, all of the five issues will not be finally fixed before agreeing on our entire concept. I sincerely apologize for making you feel bad as we had different perceptions on this. Unfortunately, instead of hiring a formal external speaker you chose to split the presentation tasks so you can hold the speech and I do the awards. This means we have to assure the formal character by setting a suitable dresscode, decoration and other ways in our event communication. I don't mind the division of the presentation tasks as it is only fair for me the take this compromise as I took one for the catering in the final step, too. However, I am absolutely confident that we have excellent chances to win the competition with this agreement. Thank you for having these enriching discussions! I'd say - let's make ISA's annual conference unforgettable!! All the best and see you soon, Alex
Dear Chris, I am pleased about our previous cooperation and I am very happy with the issues we have setteled by now. But there are severel aspects we haven't talked about yet. So I would like to make some proposals to you. What kind of music act do you think should we organize for the celebration? Over the last years I noticed that the guests did not really like the music acts. Therefore I would propose a famous international act like DJ Happy. About the Catering I do also think that an international orientation would be a good thing. What do you think about an international buffet? I think a buffet is very communicative and helps to make contacts. We also need to set the date of the conference. Do you have any proposal? Furthermore I think it would be a good idea to select Art Inc. as a sponsor because they have been supporting us for a long time. Have you already thought about the opening ceremony? Do you have any ideas how to organize it? I am looking forward to receiving your answer.   Kind regards, Alex  
Dear Alex, Thank you for your proposals. I am also very pleased to have an experienced teammate like you as partner in this competition. First of all I think that we both joined this competition, not only to prove our organizational skills, but also to get the best possible result for ISA regarding the event. To insure that it is really important in my opinion to show all Russian guests that ISA is able to adopt the Russian culture and include it into ISA's thinking. This would ensure that ISA can aquire new contacts with Russian enterprises.  Therefore I would suggest to get local Russian cuisine instead of an international buffet and a local Russian band instead of DJ Happy to set the atmosphere. I totaly agree with your opinion that communication is one key element at this event and maybe we could ensure that with mixed seating arrangements between Russian guests and ISA's members? What do you think of this? As date I would set some day within the third week which has the right distance to the chrismas holidays so that most guests can still attend but it is near enough to catch the holiday feeling. Do you agree on that? Regarding the sponsor issue I also think that Art Inc. would also be a good choice. But seeing that Boomerang nearly offers the same amount of money and in addition a long term contract for further ISA events, I would pick Boomerang to give ISA the possibility of a new aquired enterprise contract and financial security. What is your opinion on that? And what do you think about the other two candidates ? Furthermore I think we should split the opening cermony and one of us should organize the opening speech and the other the announcing of the winners of this year's awards. Do you have any preferences on that ? I am looking forward for your feedback. Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, thank you for your comments on my proposal. I totally agree to execute the celebration in the third week because I also think that this has the right distance to Christmas holidays. I am very happy that we agree on that. I can assure you that I also want to support our organization with this event. But it is not only the celebration of the russian subsidiary but also of our 40th anniversary. Due to that fact many international long term members will be present at the celebration and therefore it is important that the celebration has an international character. If we only focus on the russian guests it would not fit to our multicultural orientation. This could dissapoint our international guests. I am pleased that we agree about the fact that communication is very important for the celebration. But I think that an international buffet would support the communication much more than a mixed seat arrangement. If we have a fixed seating arrangement the networking will be very limited. This could endanger our goal to aquire many new contacts with russian companies. Besides I think that russian music is very special and does not fit to our multicultural character. Therefore the atmosphere of the whole event could suffer and we cannot show the real ISA spirit which is young and international. What do you think about picking the Pop band FreeLife? I am sure they can also play some famous russian songs. To show our russian orientation we could also hire a third person of a big russian company for the presentation. This could be very beneficial for our event. What do you think about that? Relating to the sponsor I think that we should choose between Art Inc. and Boomerang because their offers are better than the offers of the two other companies. As I said, I would prefer Art Inc. because they have been supporting us for a long time and I think they would also be a good partner in the future. As I would really like to come to an agreement with you I would make the concession to take Boomerang as a sponsor. But I would like to ask you If you would accept the international buffet in return. I am looking forward to your answer. Kind regards, Alex    
Dear Alex, thank you for your Feedback on my suggestions. I am really glad that both of us want to act in favour of our organization at this event. Reagrding the communication issue I see your point of limited communication, but since this will be a long evening which goes long beyond diner I am convinced that people will be rotating on tabels to get in communication, seeing that they will also be intrested to ISA or rather Russian enterprises. I am not arguing against the idea to include also the international perspective for long term ISA members, however I think at a big event like the 40th birthday of ISA a buffet would really harm our prestige. Therefore I suggest that we should really concider to include at least a three course meal to insure a certain level of formality, considering that a lot of very important people will be there as you said. Maybe we can come to some sort of arrangement which fits for both our perspectives if we include the international aspect of ISA by getting an international three course meal and the Russian spirit by hiring a local Russian band. What do you think ?  Besides I am convinced that the presentation is not enough to show our abillity to adapt Russian culture, seeing that it will have just an influence at the beginning of the event and a local Russian band would be there for the howl evening. This would perfectly represent the fact to include their perspective at ISA's long term thinking. In additon I think that for a 40th birthday it would be better if an ISA member would start the event with the presentation. It also would be great career opportunity for us both if we would do the speech and the presentation of the awards and would get there some attention in exchange for some more organization effort. Even if I know that the given tasks (speech and award announcing) are not equaly distibuted regarding the possibility to prove themselfs and to get attention I would offer you to hold the opening speech if you accept Boomerang as sponsor in exchange. Boomerang as sponsor is the right choice concidering my opinion on account of the long term contract they offer us for hiring them as sponsor. This would give ISA a secure future perspective. However Art Inc. does not offer such a secure long term perspective and I don't think we will lose them as partner seeing that they allready signed up for sponsering some future events of ISA. I hope that my suggested solution fits both of our needs and perspectives so that we can come on an agreement.  Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, thank you for your response. I am really happy that you also see the multicultural aspect of the celebration. Altough I think that an external speaker could be very inspiring for all of us, I totally agree that the presentation would be a great career opportunity for both of us. Thank you for your offer to leave the opening speach to me. It would be an honor for me to hold it. I think that we shouldn't forget that first of all ISA is a student organisation. Therefore I think it is really important to focus on the students and satisfy their needs. The students are our future talents and we can't attract the business partners if we do not have attractive talents. I think the students would prefer a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere because this makes it much more easier to get in contact with the business partners. If we would serve a three course meal the students wouldn't feel so relaxed. It would be much easier to get in contact with the business partners while having a buffet. This would suit to our event perfectly as it is primarily the 40th anniversary of a student organisation. I think it would be a big mistake not to focus on the needs of the students. I would still prefer an international orientation of the music act, but to include some russian spirit, as it is also the celebration of the russian subsidiary, I would agree to the local Russian Band if you agree to the international buffet. If so, Boomerang would also be ok for me.  I really hope that you can accept my proposal and we can come to an agreement. Kind regards, Alex
"Dear Alex, thank you for your feedback. Since I still think that a buffet will harm our prestige since we are organizing a 40th anniversary of a well established organization and not a studends party I think we should more focus on the needs of our enterprise contacts. And in addition I think every studend who will attend there will be very motivated to get in touch with one of the enterprises and don't has to be relaxed to do this ;). But since this is a team competition and I guess to win this competition we both have to be on board for this I accept your offer so that we can start organizing and stop negotiation.  So therefore thank you for the negotiation. I am excited to get started. Kind regards, Chris"
Dear Chris, I am Alex, we are partners for this project. I really enjoy to work with you. In thiis message you can see the aspects that I consider important for this event, as the sponsor selection for example, i think it would be a real good idea to continue with the Art Inc. because we have been working with them since long time ago and we have the insurance that will not be any problem with them and for the other part we also know how they work and is a good point to consider. About the catering i think is better to have an International buffet where everybody can find every type of food so there will no be any problem for those people who can not eat an specific things so they will have more choices. A continue I woould like to talk about the date of the conference as is not decided yet, the third week of December would be the best option for everybody. That week all the higher members could be present (they do not have any other appoitment for that week), and also it will not be collapse with other companies meetings. So for that week we will be the only company which will be celebrate and event like this and more guest could participate. Another point to consider is the music Act, the latest years i observerd that so many guest were no satisfied with that. Is really important to make all our guest confortable with that. Nowadays there is a very popular Dj, Dj Happy, it will be really good if we achieve to bring him to our event. He has so many successful event done and also a lot of expierence and with his help we can obtain a really good atmosphere in the event. And the last point that i would like to mention  is about the presentatio. I think is a really good chance for let us know a little more to foreign people, so i was thinking about to  distribute this. i could do the speech presentation at the beginning and you could do the awards to the winners. Well these are my ideas let me know what do you think about this. For any question you can send me as much emails as you want. Kind regards. Alex
Hi Alex, Thank you for your considarate offer. I have some commets to some of the points and I hope we can agree on some compromises. The first thing I would like to say is that I think it would be good since the event is taking place in Russia that we have a russian theme of the events. I would like to Catering: local Russian cuisine  and that the Music Act: Local Russian band . When it comes to the Date of Conference: Week 4  would be optimal in my opinion. Week 1 would also be a better alternative for me. When it comes to the Presentation Tasks: Shared activities  . Of course I understand that you want to do the opening speech because it is obvisously the most attractive task. I would also like to do the opening speech. In this matter I think the best thing is to share the activities. What do you think about that? The Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  is the most preferable becuase they offer the possiblity to sign a long term contract that would be very good for the company.   Best Regards Chris
Hi Chris, I read your offer and there are some points that unfortunatelly ï¿½ am desagree. Yes is right, the event will take place in Russia but even that i think that the Catering: International buffet  should be a buffet. As I told in the last message probably not everybody will like the russian food so it would be better an international buffet, that does not mean that there will not have a russian food. I mean, is a buffet so we can add food from everywhere and this would be more succesfull than have only russian food. It happens the same with the music. The man that I suggested is a Dj, so he can also play music from everywhere. It means that there will be more variety and not so monotonous all time. And if not also pop life band will be great. About the Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  they have been supporting us for long time and we have a really good relationship with them. if we continue like this, they  will continue supporting us. In the opposite case, our relationship will be get worse and we could not ensure they will help us in other events when we need them. Boomerang company is also good but we do not know them and how they work and this time this event is so important so maybe is better to guarantee that we will have a good support. About the Date of Conference: Week 3  The fisrt week is the worst one i think because that week there is also an another meeting from other company. And the fourth week is good but it is so close to Christmas so probably many people will go back to their houses and do not participate to our event. If we want more guests to come, the week 3 should be the best option for the most of the people. And the last thing, Presentation Tasks: Shared activities , I am agree about to share the activities. Like this we both could do the each things. Hope you can reconsider all these points. I really think that those topics will be the most appropriate. Kind regards. Alex.
Hello Alex, Ok, your last offer looks very much the same as your previus offer. Something that I think is important is that the event has a Russian theme. Catering: local Russian cuisine  and Music Act: Local Russian band  . If I get to decide this I am willing to accept that we chose the Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. . I can also compromise on the Date of Conference: Week 3  but then you will have to compromise also.   Best Regards Chris    
Hi Chris, Our desagreement is basically about the Catering: International buffet  and about Music Act: FreeLife   About the catering i am still thinking that the best option is a buffet i will make sure that there will be also rusian food as the event will take place there. and about the music also is the same. The russian band is good but with the another one there will be more variety. Kind regards. Alex.
Hi Alex,   Ok so I guess that The Catering: International three course meal  is very important to you but if you want to have your way there you have to give me some influence in other topics. I also want to remind you that I compromised with the Date of Conference: Week 3 .   My question is that if we can keep the Date of Conference: Week 3  if you can agree on the international three course dinner, which in my opinion will be better than a buffet. And in that case I want Music Act: Local Russian band  the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  and the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang . Regards Wictor
"Hi Wictor ;) You almost changed all tge offer. We both know that is a really good chance to do the presentation for let us know. So if you want to do the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  i think we have to let to other points like before: Catering: International buffet   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Music Act: FreeLife   And for make possible this nagotiation i remember that you told that you prefer have the Date of Conference: Week 4  right?  Like this we both have some points that  we wanted at the beginning. Kind regards. Alex."
Hi Alex,   I think you misunderstood me. It is very hard for me to accept the international buffet. If you want that you have to give me more than just the speech and the Date of Conference: Week 3 . If you want the international buffet you have to give me the Music Act: Local Russian band  and the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang as well. A side note: Can you answer a bit quicker. I will not be able to negiate tomorrow so it would be good for me to be done with the negotiation today. Regards Chris  
Hi Chris, I don't know you but i have a lot of work to do not only this negotiation. If you want to finish the negotiation today it's really easy, you could accept my offer. For you the international buffet is really bad and also Catering: International three course meal  is bad for me. But we can do that if you accept the other conditions Music Act: DJ Happy  Date of Conference: Week 3   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Kind regards  Alex.
Sorry Alex but this negotiation isn't going anywhere. If you think it's reasonable that I compromise with the Catering: International three course meal  and that you then expect me to accept all the other conditions so that it fits your best solution then we can't come to an agreement. In the future I hope you will consider to try to find a compromise that is reasonable for all parts. Otherwise I'm sorry to say that you wont be a successful negotiator. You negotiated hard but now that I'm rejecting you don't get anything instead.
Hey Chris, thanks for the already settled issues together without any problems. I thought about the open aspects and make you an offer for all points. I think it is important to make a celebration for students because they are the base of ISA. That's the reason why i want to do the celebration very international for example related to the catering and the music act. Especially for the music act I think we have to present a famous international act, because I noticed in the last years an increasing dissatisfaction of the guest with the music acts. Also the selection of the sponsor is very important for me. I think we should consider our good relationship with Art Inc for not loosing them in future.   I hope we will find a good solution for all points. Best regards Alex
Hi Alex! Thanks a lot for your message! I can really understand your international approach, since ISA has over 30000 members spread around over 20 countries. The thing is that at the moment and in this particular and special situation the attraction of new students can be only at most the second most important issue of our organisation. By entering into a new market such as Russia it is first of all very important to build up a strong base for the future. Hence we shall have an overall orientation towards the Russian culture. One thing that is very important is the music act. Although DJ Happy is very popular among young people his popularity will be damaging for our 40th anniversary - we can't allow our organisation to be a side-act of DJ Happy. If DJ Happy will play his music he will distract the guests attention from ISA to his music. Do you really want this? On our 40th anniversary? Regarding the catering: Such a big event with such important guests deserves something bigger than just a buffet. A russian meal would be just beneficial to everybody... the young people as well as the business guests. International students want to explore the Russian culture, the Russian way of living, in order to make a choice whether to look in Russia for a job or not. Please take your time for thinking and have a nice day, kind regards, Chris!
  Hey Chris, Thanks for your answer. I am happy you agree with my proposals for sponsor selection, presentation tasks and date of conference. I think it's a very good decision to stay on our roots and take Art Inc. for sponsoring. But I have still some problems with your basic idea for the celebration. I think it is very important to cater it for our client base, students. I really understand it's important to build up a strong base in Russia but we shouldn't forget our base, because without our students the companies aren't interested. I think if we get students, the business partners automatically work with our ISA. Furthermore we should pay attention to avoid complacency in our organization. I think ISA is getting older, and I don't like this fact. I hope you understand my reasons for putting the students in the focus of this event.  Regarding the music act I can't agree. I think a local Russian band doesn't fit the character of an international association's meeting. Don't forget there won't be only Russian guests. Furthermore in the last years our guests weren't excited from our music acts. I think DJ Happy is a good choice, because he is known international and fits the atmosphere for young people. DJ Happy can also play Russian music and he knows how to regulate the mood, because of his experience. In my opinion we absolutely need an international act. Also I don't like your idea of a Russian meal. I think we can't focus the event completely to Russia. We are an international organization and there will be people from all over the world. Maybe not everybody likes the special Russian cuisine. Furthermore a buffet supports an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances. Also I think with a buffet everyone has the choice of the food itself. So we can make an international buffet, also with Russian food, and everybody is able to find something they like. Please think about my proposals. Best regards, Alex
Hi Alex! 1. Why do you think is it important for ISA as a company to have its subsidiaries spread all over the world and why especially in Russia nowadays? 2. Why is it important for the members of ISA to have ISA's offices and connections spread all over the world? 3. Why do students actually join ISA? To be a member of a nice and dynamic student-association? I don't think so.. We both know that students join associations like this to build up a base for their future career. We want to provide our members the opportunity to work in big and important organizations some day. Everybody knows that Russia is going to be the place to make money and the country to cooperate with in the near future. Just check the news, read the papers. Why should ISA-students go to our Russian subsidiaries if we can't offer them job-perspectives in this promising country ??? Look..this is the typical chicken-egg problem (who shall be first..the chicken or the egg?), but our solution is much easier: Option 1 (international approach): By having a young, international and dynamic event in Russia we will atract a lot of students, but mostly students from Russia (!), to join ISA. But the problem: These Russian students will join ISA to use ISA's international connections in order to LEAVE RUSSIA. By extracting Russia's young talents out of Russia the Russian society and especially the Russian companies WILL HATE US since we know that economic growth is very important for Russia today. We won't be able to build up business connections with Russia in the future! Option 2 (the Russian way): Since we already have an enormous number of international talents in ISA it is GUARANTEED that the Russian companies WILL LOVE TO build up partnerships with us. Since Russia is the next big market Russia's companies are at the moment STRIVING FOR international young talents from all over the world. After having the Russian companies as our partners our number of students will increase even faster because then we will be able to offer them even better job perspectives (e.g. in this newly opened big market of Russia) ! So what should be first, the ckicken or the egg? The international or the Russian way? In this case only the Russian way will lead us to future success. Please don't gamble away that big chance of us because it is very rare that a chicken-egg-problem can be solved in such an elegant way. Looking forward to reading from you! Kind regards, Chris.
"Hey Chris, Thank you for your detailed answer. It is a really interesting way of argumentation but I am not able to follow your logic and can not accept your way of writing. I thought it is possible to write kindly and negotiate on a faire base. But at first you missed the deadline and now you slam up my point of view on a contumelious way. Bummer! But I think we have to find a solution so my arguments and proposals: As you know of our detailed information it is not just the opening of the Russian subsidiary. It is furthermore the event for the 40th anniversary and I think it has to be an international event, because ISA isn't only for Russian people. My opinion related to Option 1: Why do you think only Russian students will come to our event if it is an international one? It's the 40th anniversary and all our members will be invited. And I think that's the main reason to do it on an international way. If it is an international event our students from all over the world will come and they have the possibility to connect with the Russian companies. Furthermore it is an international organization, if the Russian business partner have the goal to save the Russian students in the own country they should join a local organization. My opinion related to Option2: You say ""we already have an enormous number of international talents"" that's the point why I want to have an international event to celebrate our 40th anniversary. It isn't an event only for our new Russian business partner and it should underline our international culture. I think Russian companies also want to meet international students and not only the Russian ones. I think it isn't a chicken-egg problem with one solution. I think we should find a middle ground to satisfy all our guests. The business partner from all over the world as well as the students. So my proposal: We can have a local Russian band to satisfy the Russian guests but instead I want to have an international buffet. We can have meals from all the countries, our subsidiaries are. So everybody has the chance to get to know meal from other countries. Furthermore a buffet decentralize the mood and it's easier to get to know people, who don't sit next to you. Best regards, Alex"
Hi Alex! Sorry, I did not intend to be rude. I tried to keep my last message as concise as possible due to its fullness. That's the reason for the dry, technical and maybe harsh character of my last message. Let me quick explain you my argument and why it actually is logical based on an fictional example: Imagine ISA opens a new subsidiary in a 3rd world country because ISA smells some opportunities in this country, which are unseen at the moment. Imagine that ISA will not pay enough attention to the aspiring possible business partners but instead will choose an international student-oriented approach for the opening-event? The possible business partners will be ignored and after that they won't join our organization. The result: No international student would like to go to our subsidiary in this 3rd world country but instead all students from this 3rd world country would use ISA as a bridge to escape to a richer country ..and this 3rd world country wouldn't be happy about us because we would steal their few talents. Companies in such countries want to have international talents as well as international investors in order to grow economically. They usually do not have enough talents within their country's borders. And btw... by focusing on our business partners at our  40th anniversary we will show them a lot of respect and make us even more attractive to them. Russians admire such acts offriendship. So..back to our negotiation: Yes, of course I am up for a bilateral agreement but unfortunately I really can't accept your current new offer. Please let me explain why: I have negotiated with you only about 2 topics so far: The music-act and the catering. I have ignored all the other 3 important issues regarding sponsoring, presentation tasks and date of conference completely. Here are some notes regarding some of my so far ignored issues: Regarding the presentation task: You know that I am an experienced member of ISA and have paid a tremendous amount of effort in this career so far. Holding the opening speech would be actually important for me in order to get a final chance to prove our leadership that I am ready for a higher position in ISA, for which I've been striving for a long time. But okay, ..this is an individual goal, so I can accept a disadvantage in this case in order to find an agreement with you which really serves our organization and not only myself. Regarding the sponsor selection: Art Inc. is a very risky sponsor. While Art Inc. is really ready to pay the highest amount of money it isn't ready to sign a long term contract. But Russia needs long-termed economical security badly at the moment (!). Just check the Ruble (Russian currency) or the oil-price. The last thing that Russian companies could need at the moment is financial uncertainty. Only Boomerang is ready to pay a great amount of money and sign a long termed contract at the same time. Well.. although it is a very important fact I can still accept Art. Inc. as a sponsor since they turned out to be (despite their strong preference for short term contracts) more or less loyal partners in the past. Now to the offer: Ok.. so having a buffet is a pretty bad decision in my point of view, because it is too casual and unofficial to impress and to honor our guests and to celebrate the 40th anniversary. Only a three course meal would provide a certain level of prestige. I could agree with you on a more international approach, but only, if you allow me to mention the other topics, which I was ready to ignore completely in my last offer: I am willing to have an International meal and to accept your suggested Conference date if you are ready to provide a financial certainty to our potential business-partners by selecting Boomerang as our sponsor. Boomerang still offers a lot of money, more, than the other companies. Also it would be very nice of you to let me hold the speech because I've been working very hard for a long time just to get the chance to prove my competence infront of my leadership and to get a higher position in ISA. This opening speech has been my personal goal for a very long time. So here you have my offer. Please take the time you need to think about it :) Thanks for having time! Kind regards, Alex :)
Hey Chris, Thanks for your honest answer. I didn't argument about the other topics because you didn't say anything about that. I just wondered about that. I think our fundamental idea of the celebration is very different. Maybe, in consideration of the time, we should find a compromise which satisfies the two of us. Because I think we have the same main goal, winning the competition :-) I can accept your sponsor selection Boomerang. I think Art Inc. would be a better choice because of our good relationship and I fear to lose them but with Boomerang we are save for the future and I accept your wish. But if I accept your sponsor selection I want to have the international buffet. I think it isn't a bad decision and too casual or unofficial. In my point of view diversity and quality of the meal are essential. Furthermore I think we have to satisfy as much as possible guests so a buffet is a good way to present a big choice and everyone can pick what he or she likes mostly. But I have still a problem with the decision about presentation tasks. I also want to present me and get the chance to rise up in our ISA. But I want to propose you to give you the speech but instead of that I want to have DJ Happy. With DJ Happy we also present our students a highlight and he can mix up the music better than every other DJ. So I think he can regulate the atmosphere on the evening very well. I hope you understand it would be important for me too to have the speech but for me it is important to have a nice evening and I want to have a nice international atmosphere, and I am sure the business people will also like such an event because they know ISA is a student organization and for me it is very important to present us with focus on our roots. I think in my offer we both have benefits and disadvantages. You have your sponsor and your presentation task. I've got my music act and the catering. So it's I think the date of the conference is fix, because it's the only week without conflicting other events or situations. Or do you want to have another date? Do you think it is a good mix? I would agree and think the evening will be successful for the ISA and I think we have a good chance to win the competition.   I hope you understand my point of view. Best regards, Alex
Hi Alex! Thanks for the reply! I thank you a lot for being ready to let me hold the presentation, since I can understand that holding the speech would be a great opportunity for you as well. But well, ISA's goal isn't my personal career but it's future in Russia. Therefore I am not able to follow just my personal goal of holding this speech and to ignore other important facts at the same time I think that we already know the economical constraints of this situation regarding the business partners and Russia's current troublesome but at the same time promising situation. Having just Boomerang as our sponsor is unfortunately way too little. I see that you are really up for DJ-Happy, so we could let him play if we at least would offer a real Russian cuisine to our future business partners. That would be the very minimum that we must offer to our potential future business partners. I even am ready to let you hold the speech just to give you the opportunity to introduce yourself powerfully to ISA and to show you that ISA's goals are above my personal wishes. Unfortunately we don't have much time left and I think that the current constellation is a bit less harmful to our business partners and to ISA. Well, all the work I have done to the company will not pay out at that anniversary, but yeah.. who knows, maybe in future. Looking forward to reading from you!  :) kind regards, Chris
  Hey Chris,   Sorry but I have decline your offer. I think there is no way to find a solution which satisfy our interests.   Furthermore I can't follow your arguments and opinions. Yesterday you wanted to have the speech in any case and now you change your mind.   I am sorry but regarding the time left there's no way to find a solution together. I think we wrote insufficient messages. But sorry, I have to say, I was disappointed from your behaviour until yesterday evening. But then it was too late. Sorry!   I really can't accept your offer because sponsoring and catering are my most important issues and I can't accept to get no one of them. I would have been very happy if we had found a common solution but on this way there is no possibility for me.   Best regards,   Alex
Hi Chris, here are my proposals for the issues we haven't solved yet. For the catering I suggest an international buffet. I think this is best in order to facilitate communication betweeen people during the evening. Then everyone is free where to sit, when to eat, what to eat, and can talk to different people and make contact. I suggest international food because there will be people from so many different countries that i think a local cuisine is too specific and doesn't cover the taste of a large portion of our guests. As date i assume week 3 to be the most convenient one. Maybe week 4 could be an alternative. But I think the rest of the month would be a bad choice because of christmas and the other events that take place in december. Concerning music, what do you think of DJ Happy as a famous and international DJ? I have the feeling people haven't been really interested and contented with our music acts at the last ISA events. So we should try to get a musician that people are familiar with and could enjoy. Then we have to decide who is going to make the speech and the awards. Do you prefer one of that or are you fine with both? I would rather like to do the speech than the awards. And finally I propose Art Inc. as sponsor, as we really have good experiences with that company in the past. Even though Boomerang made a good offer, I think we should considere our good relationship to Art inc. They will surely be eager to support us in the future again. So far, these are my proposals. What do you think about these aspects?  Best regards Alex
Hi Alex,   Thank you for the message. I read your proposals and noticed that unfortunately some of our conceptions differ. I hereby send you my considerations regarding the not solved issues.   Since a successful start for the new office in Saint Petersburg can only be assured by establishing contacts to as many local business people and officials as possible, I see the new subsidiary celebration combined with the 40th anniversary as a good occasion for marketing. The celebration will attract many important public figures and the presence of long-term members of ISA will invite many new potential partners. I see it as a great opportunity to show that we adapt to the local culture and want to create long-term partnership with them. Considering that the participants represent important people who expect a certain level of formality, it suits better a Local Russian cuisine in order to show the new members that they are important to ISA and to make them feel appreciated. I strongly consider that having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes.   Regarding the music, I have no doubt about DJ Happyï¿½s reputation. However I guess his music style would be probably more attractive for the younger generation. I also think itï¿½s too risky to consider DJ Happy since there is no guarantee that his reputation would not overshadow the reputation of the ISA, distracting attention from the event towards the music act. In order to focus on establishing a good relationship with (local) companies and officials, I would recommend a Local Russian band, also to show our familiarization to their culture. However, a colleague of mine told me that the music from the pop band FreeLife is suitable to accompany the evening without being the main act and that they would probably satisfy most guests. This band could also be an option.   I acknowledge our good relationship with Art Inc. but although they did a very good offer, its terms consider a short-therm payment directly for this event. I know that Art Inc. has always donated some money for different events but without a written contract regarding the future, Art Inc. can always decide to change their intentions. I see this option without future perspectives as a factor of uncertainty, which can only hurt the ISA in the long run. Deciding for Boomerang, we would make sure that also the financial perspective of ISA is safe for the upcoming years.   I really would like to put my ability with speeches under proof at this event. But it is fine like that, you do the opening speech and I do the awards ceremony. And as a date range for the conference, I also conjecture week 3 as an appropriate week considering other events and the fact that it takes place on December.   I'm looking forward to your answer.   With best regards,   Chris
Hi Chris, it seems we can agree on the Date and the Presentation Tasks at least. This is a good basis. If I really can't convince you of DJ Happy I would also accept the band FreeLife. But i would not be very happy with that. I think we really have differing basic opinions on what the purpose of this celebration should be and thus how it should be planned and conducted. I believe we shouldn't focus too much on business people and making contacts to companies there, but rather go back to our roots and our motives that determine what ISA is: namely an organisation with and for students. I suppose we have to meet anywhere in between, giving the focus on both, the student side and the business aspect. This is not going to be easy, but I am convinced we will make this and find a solution we are both pleased with. As to the catering I think we shouldn't focus too much on the local people. First of all even those people are familiar with international food and secondly, the major part of our guests definitely will be of international background. And as I mentioned in my last message, a buffet is much more benefical if we want to facilitate conversation and networking...even to russian business people. Regarding our sponsor, you may didn't get the information yet, or got it wrong, but Art Inc. is willing to sign a long term contract if we choose them. Then we have certainty for future events. This i a great advantage and shouldn't be ignored. Of course the donation amount by Boomerang is higher, but it is only a one time payment. This is a huge disadvantage that sould not be ignored. But obviously we have to make some compromise here, because otherwise we won't come to a conclusion as our opinions differ here. So, even if I am absolutely convinced that Art Inc should be our sponsor I would accept your request for Bommerang. But then you should accomodate in the catering issue. Then we both have a solution that we like better and one we like less. What do you think? Best regards Alex    
Hi Alex, Our basic opinions really differ. I consider the companies and business people more important because they are the ones requiring our experienced student-members and without their vacancies, our association gets uninteresting for students.   In any case, It is also my opinion that we should meet somewhere in between and I hereby send you my proposal. I see two possibilities for showing to the locals that we adapt to their culture and to make they feel appreciated: food or music. We should not forget that the celebration is also about ISAï¿½s 40th Anniversary, a special event that requires, at least, a special menu. Having anything less than a three course meal would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years (which werenï¿½t even some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversary). But I agree with the argument that an International Buffet enable an easier networking among the participants. For this benefit, I would agree on an International Buffet but I would insist on the Local Russian Band with the intention of showing some adaptance to the culture. In my experience at ISA it definitely pays off to adapt at least partly to the local culture. Concerning our sponsor, the information I got is the one I sent on my previous message and differs from yours. I would need some time to get in touch with both sponsors to confirm the information. So regarding our Sponsor, for the moment we can keep it as you described since I made a compromise on the catering issue already. What do you think? Best Regards,   Chris
"Hi Chris, actually my offer to agree to boomerang as sponsor was a concession in return to having a buffet, and conditional on having FreeLife as music act. But if it is that important to you to have at least one russian ""influence"" I would be willing to accept the russian band to make up for the buffet. But then of course we have decide on the sponsor independently of catering and music. And since I think I am much more bothered with a russian band than you are with a buffet, I think it would be quiet faire to decide for Art Inc. here. I really hope you are fine with that! Best regards Chris"
Alex, I am not less bothered with a buffet! There are relevant reasons why a buffet should not be considered. It is the annual conference of ISA (an important event itself) and it will involve the participation of important people. More than this, it is also the celebration of ISAï¿½s 40th Anniversary and even more, in combination we have in a country where our first attempt failed in 2004, the celebration of a newly subsidiary that will involve as well important public figures as potential business partners. So, this is our big opportunity to impress and show appreciation. Having a buffet would be a huge downgrade of the last few years, which were not even some special events as this one is. This would for sure harm the prestige of ISA! So, agreeing with the catering was a big concession from me and, in my opinion, the fact that at the beginning I agreed with not getting the opening speech on presentation tasks, even that I would like to get it, should also be considered. I think my last proposal was fair. Concerning our sponsor, as I said before it could take some time until I contact both in order to confirm the information. To consider an agreement with Art Inc. before this happen, I would like to get the opening speech, keeping Local Russian Cousine for catering due to the mentioned relevant reasons. Then, for the music act, I could agree with the Band FreeLife, since Iï¿½ve heard about festivals with DJ Happy as a performer and I canï¿½t imagine to have ISA as a ï¿½side-actï¿½ to DJ Happy. This fact makes DJ Happy not negotiable for me, sorry. Chris
Hi Chris, it seems I totally missinterpreted your preferences concerning catering and music. I never had the intention to make a bad offer to you, just thought this would exhibit potential for improvements for both of us. Now i see that I was wrong with that. I think we headed to the right way before that and regret moving away from where we have been. Thus i suggest to continue with your last offer right before my last one. That was having an international buffet, in week 3, with a local russian band, speech by me and you having the awards, and boomerang as our sponsor. From a friend of mine I know, that our team performance is the criteria according to which our concept is going to be evaluated. So we should now try to find some points where we both can improve our own position and therefore our joint utility. Hopefully I am not wrong again, but maybe we both benefit if instead of a russian band we chose FreeLife and in return you are going to make the speech or a third person. If not, please let me know. Then we will try to find annother solution. Best regards Alex    
Hi Alex, It is no problem, this happens. I just wanted to show you that I was making concessions already. Thank you for sharing the information from your friend. Talking about the last offer we were referring to, I donï¿½t think we should choose the Band FreeLife for the music act since it is an option that both of us donï¿½t want most. This leads to fewer points than we could get concerning the team performance. We donï¿½t benefit with it. I confirmed the information with the sponsors. Boomerang made a very good offer but offered slightly less money for the event compared to Art Inc. Moreover, Boomerang is the only one willing to sign a long-term contract. In this contract, they would ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. Art Inc does not consider signing a contract and although you they have always donated some money for events, without a written contract regarding the future, Art Inc. can always decide to change their intentions. The long-term contract with Boomerang ensure financial security for ISA and this is very important for the Association. So I am sending the proposal again. I hope you understand my placements and that this way we can reach a very good joint outcome. Best Regards,   Chris
Hi Chris, after carefully considering your last offer I'm glad to tell you that we have a deal. I think I will surely need my time to get used to a russian band. But as long as I can have international food while listening to this music I will be fine. And so will be our guests. I have to admit that i may mixed up something ragarding the sponsor. Art Inc. is just willing to accept a one termin payment, indeed. That happens, when there is so much post... So all in all, I think we can both be satisfied and I think with this concept we will have great chances to win this competition. It provides a setting which combines both the focus on our students and the opportunities to make important contact to local business men. Thank you for you your commitment and cooperation! Best regards Alex
Hello Chris, I'm glad we settled the majority of issues for the 40th anniversary of the ISA. However it is essential to reach a good agreement in order to have a higher chance in the competition which both of us want to win. I know that we have opposing views on the remaining five issues. Hence both of us will have to make compromises and consider each others arguments. Therfore I am willing to let you do the opening speech in return for selecting Art Inc. as the sponsor of the event. In my opinion having Art Inc. as our main sponsor is in the best interest of the ISA since they offer the most money of the four alternatives. This is essential because organizing a large event like this is very costly. For the issue of catering I would prefer an international buffet because it represents a big multi-cultural organization like the ISA best. Furthermore participants walk around more and get in touch with others who are also attending the event. Therefore we are able to bring businesses and the ISA closer together since we have a more open atmosphere. As the date of the conference Week 3 would be most suitable for everyone since it doesn't collide with other events and holidays which prevent many members of the ISA on one hand and representatives of businesses on the other hand from attending. Having all of them with us would be an advancement towards the success of the event. The last issue we need to talk about is the music act. From experience I can say that the dissatification of guests with the music act has risen in the past years. Having a local band whose style is only liked by few participants should not be our goal because we want to attract a broad audience.. Therefore a famous international act will be our best option. I hope you take my points into consideration and will look forward to your reply. Best regards, Alex
Hello Alex Thanks for your offer. I agree that Week 3 would be most suitable for everyone. As you mentioned it doesnï¿½t collide with other events and holidays and also ISA members and representatives of business can attend. Also Iï¿½m accepting your proposal to do the opening speech in return for Art Inc. as the sponsor of the event. Now we need to talk about the remaining two issues. For the music act the pop band FreeLife would be a good choice to satisfy most guests. The last issue to discuss is the catering. In my opinion a local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to your new Russian members and guests. Furthermore a real menu would show a certain level of formality, since we expect many important people to be there. I look forward to your reply. Best regards,   Chris
Hello Chris, Thank you for your reply. I am glad we already agreed on three of the remaining issues. I think they represent a great compromise. The pop band FreeLife would be an OK solution as the music act. However since I would like to attract more students and future talents, DJ Happy would be a better choice. He can persue music wishes better than a band since he does not only have his own music with him but also music of other artists and genres. Therefore everybody could get some of their favorite music at some point during the event. I have to agree with you that we should show appreciation towards our new Russian members and guests. In my opinion doing this by serving Russian cuisine only is the wrong approach. There could be many participants who are not familiar with this or even dislike it. Therefore offering international food would suit this event better. We could offer food from the different countries we have members from and also serve a larger amount of Russian cuisine. A great atmosphere for networking and making acquaintances must be relaxed and easy-going which is provided in a buffet. While moving around you get to know other participants better. A more personal atmosphere also brings people closer together and a resulting relationship can last longer. In addition a buffet is more appealing to the younger generation of talents who are the core of the ISA. If only few of those attend we won't have many to present to the attending companies which is essential to get a couple of them aboard. Since catering is more important to me than the music act I am willing to contract FreeLife in return for an international buffet. In my personal opinion and experience from organizing other events this solution will be more appealing to participants. What is your view on my concession? Which issue is more important to you? Best regards, Alex
Hello Alex, In my opinion it is very important to show appreciation towards your new Russian members and guests. The atmosphere of the event should reflect some local cultural aspects, so either by serving Russian cuisine or by contracting a local Russian band. I agree a buffet is relaxed and easy-going which is a good atmosphere for networking and making acquaintances. The music act is more important to me, and it is an easy way to show ISAï¿½s interest in the Russian culture. So I am willing to serve an international buffet in return for a local Russian music band. I hope this solution is a good compromise. Best regards,   Chris 
Hello Chris, I agree with your proposal and think that we found a great compromise, especially with how we appreciate our new Russian members and still try to satisfy all of the participants. I'm glad we've reached a good agreement. I would like to thank you for compromising in the best interest of both of us and specifically for taking each others arguments into account. Hopefully we will see each other in the event committee after our project will be chosen. Best regards, Alex
Hello Chris, I am very excited to work on this project and very enthusiastic about its outcome. My name is Alex and I joined ISA in 2009 as a student member. Although this project is very challenging, I feel ready for carrying out the responsibility, since I had a great success in planning and organizing some past events. I checked the issues that we have to discuss and I am sharing with you my opinion about them in the form of offer included in this message. Please take a look at it and send me back your opinion, so we can discuss in more detail all of the issues and do our best in planning the event. I am looking forward to your answer. Regards, your partner, Alex
Hi Alex, thank you for your offer. I am also looking forward working with you! Based on my former experiences, I have unfortunately a different opinion on the way how we should organize the event.   First, I like to tell you that I agree with the date of the conference. In return, I like to ask you, if we could select Boomerang as our sponsor as Boomerang will be a great supporter of our organization, even with a little bit less among of money sponsoring than the others. Relationships are more important. I can accept DJ Happy as our musician, but in return I like to have a Russian caterer. Our conference will take in Russia, Alex. We should consider this.   Thank you for the cooperation.   Best regards
Hello Chris, As you have been member of the ISA for longer time than me, I consider your opinion about the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   better, so I can agree with you on that. Unfortunatelly I can not agree with you about the catering. I understand your point of view but don't you think that many of the guests there would be probably unfamiliar with the Russian cusine and they might not enjoy it so much? Because of this reason I suggested the International buffet. Because Boomerang are willing to sign a long-term contract, they might be a better choice than Art Inc. even though their money offer for the event is lower, so I agree with you on that as well. I am looking forward for your opinion. Regards, Alex
Hi Alex, thank for your ideas about the organization of the event. I can agree with an international musician like DJ Happy only, if the caterer is Russian or the other way round. We should have at least something Russian as our event will take in Russia. All the international members could have a taste of the local Russian cuisine. International food is everywhere available. It is nothing special.   I still consider Boomerang as the right sponsor partner as Boomerang will sign a long-term contract to support us in future events. This is the opportunity to make sure that Boomerang will sign the contract.   Hoping to find a consensus with you, Best regards Chris
Hello Chris, I am glad about all the things we agree on, but unfortunately I can not accept the Russian cusine. I think it is a big mistake to have local cusine on an event of this character, since the international guests might not find anything that they like in the Russian cusine. The ISA is an international organization and having international food would be in accordance with the type of the event. If you strongly disagree with the international buffet, we can agree on international three course meal, just to make sure that all the guests get food they like. Waiting for your opinion. Regards, Alex
Hi Alex, I am fine with the international food. In return, it needs to be a Russian Musician then. I am sure, we will find a consensus. Therefore, I am looking forward to you response. Best regards Chris
Hello Chris, Let's please think about what is the best for the overall event. Both the catering and the music act should not be with Russian character. ISA is an international organization and most of the delegates will not be from Russia. International buffet is important as a tool for networking of our business partner. Companies should see this event from business perspective as well which will increase the future number of our partners. This is important for both success of the event and long-term stability of ISA. Formallity of the Russian catering would limit our guests to sit at one place while eating food that might not be in accordance to their preferences. Please have in mind that we are long-term members and that we should consider what is best for the organization and set aside our personal benefits during the decision process. I hope we can meet half-way. Let me know if we have a deal. Regards, Alex
Dear Alex, I am very pleased to find consensus. I am looking forward working with you! Best regards Chris
Hi Chris,  Iï¿½m glad to have you in my team with your profound knowledge and Iï¿½m sure, we will create the best concept together.  All the issues that are still to be solved should be handled as soon as possible so we wonï¿½t exceed any deadlines.  Last week, Iï¿½ve made some research regarding the failed opening in Moscow and besides unforeseen problems a wrong concept was the flash point. In my mind ISA has to go back to the basics to live their vision. Since the foundation of the ISA they were a multinational organization with the focus on students. This is exactly what it makes special for students and organizations. If we can createa concept on this vision we can make the competition.  Regarding this Iï¿½ve thought about our unresolved problems and developed the plan for the event.   A big issue to attract new potential business partners is finding the right date for the event. If we choose the wrong date, members will cancel the appointment. Week three of our timeframe is the best option in my opinion (), because this date is not to close to the Christmas holidays but in a phase where people arenï¿½t struggling with loads of work.   First I thought about the first week of our timeframe but in this case the conference would collide with the International Conference on Economics and Business Management. The companies have more than enough employees to send someone to both events but Iï¿½m not sure about the signal we will transmit with this date. Maybe companies will think we donï¿½t know about the International Conference. What is your opinion?    For the sponsor issue I definitely prefer the Art Inc. They made the best offer for the event. The ISA should focus on this event to conquer the Russian market with a great event. Therefore we need a huge budget.    A perfect start of a conference is half of the battle. I think it is a great chance for us to give a speech. The opening speech is very prestigious and I think we both would love to do this job. But sharing this task requires a high coordination and I think we should investigate this power on other issues. Therefor my offer for you: You will give the opening speech and I will hand out the certificates. This leaves you with the honor of holding the opening speech.    Last but not least we need to talk about the entertainment program of our conference.   Catering and music are topics that are undervalued often. In my opinion you can better get in touch with company members in a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. To create such a mood, a buffet is helpful because people can walk around and socialize instead of having a formal dinner and where everyone is sitting down for several hours surrounded by the same people.     For our young, dynamic and international organization the right music act must be available. I thought about DJ Happy. Iï¿½m sure you know him. DJ Happy would be perfect for our event, because his presence will attract many guests.  I hope you could see the logic and benefits of my positions. Iï¿½m looking forward to read your feedback and I canï¿½t wait to implement our concept.  Attached you can find my offer in summary. Best, Alex    Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Music Act: DJ Happy   Date of Conference: Week 3   Catering: International buffet          
Hi Alex, I'm also definitely looking forward to working with you towards the best possible concept. Let's win this thing! I agree with you completely that we should try to resolve our differences quickly, so that we can then focus our full attention on (hopefully) organizing the event. Your assessment of Moscow's failure makes sense and we should do our best to learn from the mistakes made back then. It's especially important now that ISA is celebrating its 40th anniversary. Let's first take a look at the things that we can agree about. Regarding the Date of Conference: Week 3: I had the exact same week in mind for the same reasons as you did. It's indeed the best week, as it won't coincide with the business conference on week 1,  or the busy weeks before Christmas. It should also work for the high-ranking ISA members, who are travelling on week 2. I'm also sure that we both want to hold the introductory speech, as it is a great way to get recognition within ISA and I'm very thankful that you offered the opportunity to me! I'm however not completely sure if I can agree with your chosen suggestion for Sponsor Selection. I know that they have offered the best short-term contract, but I would also want to think about the long-term. Boomerang has in my opinion offered the best long-term contract and with the help of that company, we could secure our financing also for future events. Art Inc. is only ready to sign up for one event and we can never know if they decide to go for something completely different next year. Finally, the entertainment section. I strongly feel that an International Buffet would not live up to the requirements for ISA's 40th anniversary. We have done it many times before and I think it's a good option for our smaller events, but not for a special event like this. Also, if there's anything we know about Russia, it's that they love their country and the best way for us to show our appreciation would be to offer some Local Russian Cuisine. There will be many business partners present and they will for sure expect a level of formality, which the buffet cannot provide. It's true that DJ Happy is a very popular and successful musician, but I fear that DJ Happy would distract the audience's attention from the event itself and overshadow ISA's 40th anniversary. Instead, I would suggest that we hire a Local Russian Band to play. Russian-flavored entertainment and catering would be a great way to honor our new Russian members and guests, while also providing the correct atmosphere for a very special event like ISA's 40th anniversary. Therefore I would suggest that would go with these parameters: Catering: local Russian cuisine  Music Act: Local Russian band  . I'm very convinced that a Russian theme is the way to go here. In return, I would be ready to keep your suggested Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  even though it is not my favourite and then I would be ready to give you the honor of doing the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   How does my counteroffer sound to you? Looking forward to your next message! Best regards, Chris
Hi Chris, Thanks for your feedback. After reading your counteroffer, Iï¿½m sure we will win the competition, if we combine our ideas in a creative way. Your idea about the entertainment is conflictive with mine, but after reading your arguments I can see the benefit of yours. If we will offer a local Russian Cuisine the guests, which are not from Russia, will walk around and talk about the food with the local business partner. In my opinion this will create a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere, too. Thanks for your great idea. So I will accept your offer for this issue. Catering: local Russian cuisine     For the music part I would be happy, if we could make a compromise and choose the Pop band FreeLife. I recognized an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts at our events. I think the popularity of the Pop band will attract the kind of dynamic guests and keep them satisfied. Music Act: FreeLife     Regarding the Sponsor Selection I can see your concerns. Boomerang is also a very good alternative for the Sponsor, but I think ISA has a very good reputation and will find another Sponsor for the long-term payment. I think regarding to the failed event in Moscow and our 40th anniversary we will need a huge budget. Otherwise we run the risk of using the chance not optimal to strengthen the relationships between all stakeholders.  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.     I think with this concept, we will have the Russian spirit by offering local food, but also the support of our multinational thinking with the Pop band for our ISA's 40th anniversary. So I would suggest the following parameters for the issues: We will take the risk that guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine to honor our new Russian members by integrating their culture. Catering: local Russian cuisine   With the pop band we will support our multinational way of thinking. Music Act: FreeLife   In my mind, it is very important for me to have a huge budget for this event, therefore I still prefer the Art. Inc. Sponsor. I think we should offer the best food and infrastructure for our event. Therefore we need more money than for other events. For the introduction speech, I would offer the opportunity to you to address the audience, again. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.     I think for the Date of the conference we both see the benefits for week 3.Date of Conference: Week 3        I canï¿½t wait to implement our great concept.  Best, Alex
Hi Alex, Thank you for your counteroffer! I feel that we have made good progress and are already close to an agreement. Below are some comments on your latest suggestions. Thank you for agreeing with me on Catering: local Russian cuisine  . I truly believe that this will make for an unforgettable anniversary. I'm also very thankful for yet again being offered the opportunity to do Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   as it's something I'm looking forward to very much! Date of Conference: Week 3  also seems to be more or less set in stone already. The timing of the conference will be great. May I inquire if you would still be open to discuss about the Sponsor Selection and Music Act categories? I'm absolutely convinced that the smaller amount of money paid by Boomerang is balanced by their offer of long-term support. I think Art Inc. is too risky, as like I already said, they can always change their intentions. I see that this option is a factor of uncertainty, which can only hurt ISA in the long run. While I do wish for a great anniversary, we must also secure ISA's future funding. So here is my suggestion: We keep the Date of Conference, Presentation Tasks and Catering as they are right now, but make a new compromise on the Sponsor Selection and Music Act. I suggest that we go for Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  and in exchange I'm ready to agree with having Music Act: DJ Happy  as our main source of entertainment for the conference. What do you think of the new compromises? Looking forward to your answer! Best regards, Chris
Hey Chris, Iï¿½m glad to pronounce that Iï¿½m finally accept your offer. I think this agreement will reflect the advantages of our ideas to one brilliant concept. Iï¿½m able to relate your concerns about the Sponsor. However Iï¿½m still assure that a free float for the event budget would has helped us, Iï¿½ve got your point that weï¿½re also responsible for ISA's future. Iï¿½m happy about your decision, to choose DJ Happy for our music program. I think this is the way how we will attract our dynamic members. Hopefully we will win this competition, because we have a very good concept. Last but not least, I would like to thank you for the efficient way how our ideas developed with you as a partner. Best, Alex
Hi Chris, this is Alex. How are you doing? I'm happy to tell you that I'm your partner in organising the opening ceremony of the ISA event this year. Some information about my person: I joined the ISA as a student member in 2009 when starting my studies. I already have some experience in planning and organising events which were always very successful. I think this is very helpful for organising the upcoming ISA event. I already thought about some points of the event. Therefore please find attached my first offer for the plannings of the evening. I hope this meets also your interests and thoughts and conceptions. I'm really looking forward to work with you. If you have any questions please don't hestitate to ask me. Thank you and best regards, Alex
Hi Alex, I'm glad to get this first offer from your side. I'm in a little hurry, so I will provide you some information about myself later on. Regarding your offer, I'll provide you a little counteroffer, and we surely figure out a solution for both sides. I'm very happy with your opening offer in many points, but some little adjustments have to be figured out. Find my suggestion attached! Looking forward to hear from you soon! Best, Chris
Hi Chris, thanks a lot for your counteroffer. Unfortunatly I can't agree with all of your suggestions. The conference should have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances which, in my opinion, requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. Therefore I think its better when we have an international buffett. Another important aspect is the choice of the food itself. Since many of the guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, I think it would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. Of course we also can provide some russian food at the buffet. What do you think? I agree with the Local Russian band, so the event has this russian-touch you want. I think this is a very good compromise - what do you think? Thanks and best regards, Alex
Hi, thanks a lot for your counteroffer. I can go along with many of your suggestions, but the catering theme isn't that good for me. Don't you think that a local russian catering seems more authentic to international guest compared to an internation buffet, which they can week by week at events? Looking forward to figure a good package for both sides. Best, Chris
Hi Chris, thanks a lot for your counteroffer. Unfortunately I can not agree in one point - the buffet. Don't you think that it is better when the guests can choose what they want to eat? With an international buffet they can choose also russian food and things they like. Furthermore I think that a buffet provides so much different food so nobody has to eat things which they always eat and can tast different thinks. Besides this arguements its easier for uns to plan the evening with a buffet than with russian cuisine, so we dont have to especially consider vegetarians or allergic people, because the buffet is so varied. I think it's a good compromise to have the buffet because I already agreed with the Russian music band. Also I already agreed that you can do the speech. This is also a very good opportunity for you personally. Because of this all I think you should comply also with my ideas and wishes. I think we can plan a great evening together but we should find a compromise solution which fits for both of us. For me it's also very important to have a nice and successful evening. I'm sure we will have an appropriate solution when you agree with my counteroffer. Best regards, Alex
Hi Alex, true words - as you granted some important points to me, I'll go along with the international buffet. Find attached a little changing in the Sponsor Selection, which is also important to me. As I agreed with your points, do you think this sponsor might be an option for you? Keep on negotiating=) Looking forward to figure out a good solution package for both of us! Best, Chris
Hi Chris, glad to tell you that I'm accepting your offer! Super - looking forward to have a nice event. Thanks a lot with your cooperation. Best regards,Alex
"Hello Chris, My name is Alex and I am your competition partner on ISA St Petersburg Event. First of all I am glad to work with an older and experienced member of ISA and I hope that we will have a good partnership in this competition and we will be a well worked group with you. I made some research on possible topics that we will talk on them with you. I have some suggestions on the topics of the event to you. As you also know that we are a well-known international organisation, so I thought that the catering should be also as much international as we are because we will have so many guest from different countries. Therefore I thought that International Buffet could be nice for us. For the same purpose which is that we are an international and powerfull organisation, I am thinking that the high level managers of us should be in this event to make our second attempt more powerful and to show that we want to be in Russia to make a serious job. I checked the schedules of managers and thought that at the week 3, they mostly can join to this event, so it can show that our organisation is taken seriously by our managers to our guest. Music was a problem in last years, so having a good Music Act and well-known music star can make our event unforgettable, so for my opinion DJ Happy can solve our problem perfectly. For all of these preperations we will need so much finance. Our old and loyal sponsor ""Art Inc."" are offering us a good offer to solve our problems. They are our good partner for several years and they are offering so nice and big amount which is enough for all expenses. If you are also ok with that I want to provide this sponsoring- partnership with Art Inc. Last topic is important for both of us. I think that after all of this effort and work, making the speech and giving awards can be a good gift for us. I though that sharing this parts in between us can inhibit some possible problems. I want to talk to you honestly at this part. I have a big experince on talking to groups and crowds which is coming from other NGO memberships and university organisation memberships of me. On the other hand I took also some education on body language and talking to crowd to make myself better during university time. Because all of this purposes and if it is also good fo you ,I want to make speech in the event. However I don't want to take your part. I thought that you can also give the awards and close the event. As a summary for my opinion and if it is also good for you, I will open and you will close the event. I hope that we can have a deal soon. Hope to see you soon. Best Regards, Alex"
Hi Alex, thank you for your offer. I am also looking forward working with you! Based on my former experiences, I have unfortunately a different opinion on the way how we should organize the event.   First, I like to tell you that I agree with the date of the conference. In return, I like to ask you, if we could select Boomerang as our sponsor as Boomerang will be a great supporter of our organization, even with a little bit less among of money sponsoring than the others. Relationships are more important. I can accept DJ Happy as our musician, but in return I like to have a Russian caterer. Our conference will take in Russia, Alex. We should consider this.   Thank you for the cooperation.   Best regards Chris
"Hi Chris, First of all it is good to see that we are thinking same on date and also Music. About the presentation task , it was a personal opinion of mine,but if you want to make the speech than it's ok for me. However the catering and sponsor selections are much more important than us because it will show our organisation's sustainability and also reliability. We should be careful firstly on sponspor selection. Art Inc. is supporting us for many years from the years that we were less successful and less known than today. They believed us and invested our future by being our sponsor. If we are going to choose their first and most powerful competitor company ""Boomerang"" , than we will both lose both money for organisation and also reliability for the future. Because by this act we will say to Art Inc. which is our sponsor & investor from the past weaker time and even today most paying sponspor of us that we are not believing their support for the future anymore. As you also know that we were not successful for our first attempt in this country, so I thought that we should create more interaction among the guests to have more positive impact on them. Sitting on the table and having some food can not provide that for us. Than people will divide in parts like Russians and Internationals or Businessmen and Students. This can't provide our guest a chance to know each other. However if we can provide them both good food from a Buffet that there will be both Russian and other international food and where they can find everything that what they like, they can take some food, sit in a free place and talk/interact more. Of course there will be an important percentage of Russian meals on the Buffet to attract our guest, but there will be also so many people from other countries from our organisation, we should also think to them and in todays world there is nearly no traditional meal because everybody travels and interacts more than past and everybody likes something from different cuisine like Sushi or Tapas etc. This is a good chance to show our international structure. As I said that before If you want to make the speech , of course you can. I would like to give awards, but the other things can effect our project's and also our organisation's future easily. Thanks for sharing your opinion directly and also for your coorperation. Kind Regards, Alex"
Hi Alex, thank for your ideas about the organization of the event. I can agree with an international musician like DJ Happy only, if the caterer is Russian or the other way round. We should have at least something Russian as our event will take in Russia. All the international members could have a taste of the local Russian cuisine. International food is everywhere available. It is nothing special.   I still consider Boomerang as the right sponsor partner as Boomerang will sign a long-term contract to support us in future events. This is the opportunity to make sure that Boomerang will sign the contract.   Hoping to find a consensus with you, Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I am trying to reach a deal and being good partners with you, but you are not coming with something good also for me. I started to afraid to close the negotiations without a deal and cancel the project.  I am respectful to your business experience in ISA, but I am just expecting also same respect to my experience on organising successful events. I can accept your offer on sponsor selection by my respect and trust of your business experince, but I want to also see same respect to my successful organisation background.  As a summary I can accept your offer on Sponsor selection Boomerang, if you accept my offer on catering. I just want to make my job which that I am good on it. We should divide the jobs by our personal experiences. I am trying to trust your skills and I want to see just same thing from you. I hope we can get a deal soon  Thanks for your understanding, Alex
Hi Alex, please, do not take anything personally. Won't be emotional, please. Welcome to a professional organization team. I tried to explain you that the event takes place in Russia. The members except something russion. Either the food or the music.   Please take time and think about this. I am sure, you will understand my point of view. Whenever an event takes in a foreign country, there need to be presented something typical about this country. This is ISA way and has tradition.   Take your time and I hope to find a consensus.   Best regards Chris  
Dear Chris, I think that we are not getting a deal with you. If you want to organise the catering so much as Russian cuisine than I also want to have other big responsibility on the project. There is my last offer that if you let me do the speech and also sponsor selection to Art Inc. I can accept to your offer on catering. Kind Regards, Alex
Hi Alex, you give me the feeling that you are not motivated enough for this event. What a bummer! See my last offer for you. I think, this could make it. If you still disagree, you can reject my offer.   Best regards Chris
Hi Chris, We are both working to create a good organisation. As you said before there should be taken nothing as personal. I am accepting your offer and wishing a good project for both of us. Kind Regards, Alex
Dear Chris, I hope you are fine there. Regarding the competition we have to figure out some last issues about the conference. Since we have still some differing opinions about the atmosphere of the celebration, I want to make some suggestion for this important celebration, that it will become a successful and memorable event. I would suggest for theCatering: International buffet , because most of the participants are not familiar with the local cuisine and a buffet would be helpful for networking between the participants. The best Date of Conference: Week 3 , but I am open for another date if you think there is a better time slot.  Music Act: FreeLife  In my own experience from the last conference I would suggest some international artist, music everyone knows and which creates a good an enjoyable atmosphere. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  If you want we can share this part of the ceremony, so each of us get some time on the stage (If you like to do that?). A third person would be also an option. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  We need a reliable sponsor, I think they were and are the best choice for us. What do you think about that? I am open for your ideas and hints, please let me know what do you think about my suggestion. I am willing to find a solution which is best for both of us!   Best Regards Alex
"  Dear Alex,       Nice to hear from you. I hope we meet the best possible decisions for a succesful organisation.   I appreciate your offers and understand your motivation. Creating a right atmosphere to make the event satisfying for everyone is not easy and it is normal that the opinions differ.   Here are my suggestions;  "
Dear Chris, Thank you for your answer. I strongly believe we will find a good solution for both of us. I am fine with the Music Act, but regarding the Sponsor Selection and the Catering I still see a necessity to discuss. Please consider my thoughts about that. It would be very helpful for our team and for the success of the conference in general.  Regards Alex  
Dear Alex, Boomerang also made a very good offer and they want to sign a long-term contract that will ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. Since our financial security for upcoming would also very advantageous for us, I want to see Boomerang as a partner beside us. If I knew your motivation for Art Inc., I could make a better comprehension so we can come to a point.   I understand your motivation for an international buffet but don't you think it will be a little sipmle for such an event? If you international anyway, meal would be a better option, i think.   Best regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, I can understand your point. With pleasure I will explain you my thoughts. Keep in mind Art Inc. was in the past always a reliable and trustful sponsor of ISA. We benefit a lot with this agreement, not just in monetary aspects. So to stick to this relationship, we should not switch to their strongest competitor now. It may not help for foster trust.  Even itï¿½s just a short term contract, I believe itï¿½s worth to continue.  I would prefer the buffet, because it creates a very helpful atmosphere for meeting, talking and exchanging with people. Especially to meet with potential employers, it would be advantageous. To keep the international and young spirit of our student-organization, a three course meal would be too formal. This may be not helpful for the relaxed atmosphere we generally have in our events. I hope you can understand now my motivation, let me know your points about it if you still not convinced. Regards   Alex
Dear Alex, I see that both parts, Art Inc. and Boomerang have their pro and cons and i am not againist Art Inc. at all. But for the meal it is essential to have russian meal at least. Local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. It would fit our concept with local russian band as well. Best regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, thanks for your commitment.  As a local band is very good way to present the host countries culture, we should be careful with the choice of the catering. My main concern is that our members or guests from countries with religious or ethical food restrictions, a local cuisine might be a problem for some them. Since I agree for the music act, I think in that issue an international buffet will satisfy all of our participants. For an international student organization, we must take care of all members. I think our CEO would consider that as well. I agree with all other issues expect that, please consider that. As an act of good will, I would agree for shared presentation acts if you want. Best regards Alex      
 Dear Alex, Thank you for your offer but shared acts. But I think we should share the activities so that either me or you make the presentation and so on. So I can offer you Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris. And I must say that I am quite convinced about Catering: local Russian cuisine. I give my sponsor selection up  and I will probably regret it deeply if I give up my blief in local theme. Best regards. Chris
Dear Chris,  As I see you wonï¿½t change your opinion about the food, I will agree under one last condition: I would ask you to change the Music Act: FreeLife. I would agree the other parts if you can compromise with that, when the food is national, let's have at least some international music. The presentation task is not that important for me, so I expect some good will from your side. I hope you can agree with that. Kind Regards Alex    
Dear Alex, I accept your offer. I nice to negotiate with you. I was fun! Best regards. Chris
Hello Chris I just got the planning for this year. I would like to discuss this with you and I am very happy yo work with you on this project.  These are my wishes:  For Music Act I think it is better to choose DJ Happy since the objective is too satisfy more guests, and as i know, people were less satisfied with the performers in previous years. So I thiknk DJ Happy would be a good choice.  For Catering, I think it would be great to have an international buffet with international food, since we do not know everyone's preferences. And the buffet should be better than a very formal three-course meal since the objective is to make acquaintances and to discuss/talk all together.  For the Date of conference, I suppose the third week is the best date since there are other events in otehr weeks and the last week will be too late! About the Presentation Task, I woul really like to do the speech, but i think we should still talk about it. How about you? Last but not least, for selecting the sponsors, I think we should still choose Art Inc. since it is our long term partner.    Looking forward to hearing from you. Alex  
Hello Alex,   Thank you for your offer. I'm also looking forward to figure this great project out with you.   It is great that we already achieved one agreement. I completely agree with your suggestion to hold the conference in the 3rd week.   Concerning the music act, I would favour a popular local Russian band. This makes a lot of sense if you consider the fact that we want to establish a good relationship with our future partner. With booking a local band we would show our respect and interest in their culture.   For the catering I'm more for a real menu with a proper three course meal. The experience from the last years showed that such kind of catering was very well received from our guests. A buffet wouldn't reflect the level of formality of this particular event. Most importantly I'm opting for a Russian cuisine since it would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests.   As sponsors I would suggest the company Boomerang. I'm aware that they offer a lower support for this event than Art Inc. However we should also think of securing a safe future for the upcoming events. Thus Boomerang with their willingness to sign a long-term contract should be preferred.   Coming to the presentation responsibilities, I would like to deliver the opening speech since coming from a business background I would love to use this opportunity to address many important aspects of the future development of ISA.   Let me know what you think!   Best wishes, Chris
"Hello,  Thank you for your quick response.  I am glad to know we agreed on the date of conference: the third week. For the Music Act, my reason for choosing DJ Happy is because it is a famous DJ and the guests will be satisfied. Choosing the ""Local"" Band cannot really match with the character of a ""international event"" I think we need further information about it. For the catering, in my opinion a buffet can let people talk together. People can make more good relation and get to know each other well. And since we do not know what food preference people like, maybe it is better to have food from all over the world rather than only Russian food? We risk to not satisfy everyone providing only russian food.   About the sponsor, I agree that Boomerang's proposition is very interesting, and sure enough the long-term contract is a very advantageous deal! However, if we choose Boomerang, we will be in an opposite position with our long-term partner Art Inc. So I think we need to talk more about it. Finally, about the division of presentation tasks, since you already had had a lot of experiences, and I had none, I would really like to do the opening speech as a training. If you really want to do it too, how about sharing the activites so that both of us can train it. In this case we can also collaborate the whole thing. Looking forward to hearing from you! Alex "
Hello again,   I do see your point of choosing an international artist for the music act. However, I am still very much convinced that a local Russian band would be more suitable for this event. As we are expecting very important guest, among them are also seniors, DJ Happy does not seem to be the right fit. I fear that his reputation would overshadow the reputation of the ISA, distracting attention from the event towards the music act. And that would be the last thing ISA wants since we would like to establish a good relationship with the local companies and officials. I think it's important that we, in some way, show our respect and interest in the Russian culture, else this conference just wouldn't have any distinction to an ordinary one. And in my opinion, showing it through music is a really effective one.   Thinking of the catering I have to agree with you that we don't know the guests preferrences. Therefore an international menu sounds fair enough to me as well, as long as we introduce the Russian culture in another area. Concerning the seating arrangement, I would like to offer our guests a high quality experience, as they are already used to that. In my opinion would be more suitable for casual gatherings. Moreover I wouldn't worry about the people not being able to establish a connection since they are going to have plenty of opportunity to mingle during the conference.   Moving on to the next point, I understand that you would like to continue cooperating with a long-term partner. But we also have to take the fast changing business world into consideration. With Art Inc. we would always have to worry about our financial stability in case they change their mind. Boomerang, however, would be bond to us through a valid contract.   After consideration, I personally wouldn't mind you doing the opening speech. It is really a great learning point and you can approach me for support any time. I will take over the part of the award presentation.   Looking forward to hearing from you, Chris
"Hi Chris, Thank you for your answer. Firstly, thank you for giving the chance to do the opening speech, I think it would be a great experience to do it.  About the music act, I want to know what you meant when you said ""the reputation of DJ Happy will overshadow that of the ISA"" You think it will maybe become a more musical orientation event? Please give me more information about it. However, I do not mind that we prefer to show respect for Russian culture by taking russian local band. I think we just need to make sure that this band will satisfy and animate the guests. So now we agree on to do an international food. However, I would like to know how it was in the past years. I am afraid people would want some changes, be somehow more casual and be able to walk around and discuss freely with others. I think we can also provide ""high quality"" or ""luxury"" buffet food so that people will not feel like in a too normal event. What do you think?  At last I agree with you, that there is a lot of changes in economic world, and it is certainly interesting to sign a long term contract with Boomerang. We do not have to worry about financial problems later on. Only we might need to be aware that we will lose our partnership with Art Inc. by choosing its competitors. Tell me what you think about all this! Thanks, Alex  "
Hello Alex, For the start let me sum up our progress so far: We agreed on the Date of Conference: Week 3 and Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris so far, right? It's great to have those points already settled! Concerning the Music Act: Local Russian band , how you put it is exactly what I meant. In my opinion he is going to draw the audience's attention away from our organisation ISA, due to his popularity. This should not be the case, especially since we are also celebrating the 40th anniversary of our organisation. I agree with you that we need to prescreen the local bands carefully and choose the fitting one out of them. As long as their songs are upbeat and not too controversal I don't see any problems. The reason why I consider the Catering: International three course meal  as more adequate is similar. It is obvious that our organisation has established a formal and professional reputation. This characteristics should be reflected in every event we host with our 'brand'. Whereas I see your viewpoint of giving the guest the chance to network during the meal time, I don't think it will be very effective in reality. If you want to give the attendees the freedom of walking around, we would have to adapt the food accordingly. The most plausible food style would be finger food, snacks and nibbles, since curtlery would really get in the way. I, however, can not imagine serving something like that at such a prestigous celebration. Talking about the sponsor, your expressed doubts are justified. However as I don't think that Boomerang and Art Inc. are serving the same customer market, I'm optimistic that Art Inc. will continue supporting some of our events, as done before.    Looking forward to hearing from you again! Best wishes, Chris
Hello Chris,  Yes, now I agree on the Date of Conference: Week 3 , Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris , and I agree with you by choosing a new Sponsor Selection: Boomerang since it proposed a very attracting long term contract. About the Music Act: Local Russian band  , since we are doing an international gastronomie, I think your concern is right, let's take the local russian band. This might also decrease our bedget stress. So already 4 points are done now However, about the catering, I should still discuss more with you. I think the ISA is still a student organization. It is certain that there will be important guests, even the organization's CEO etc. I agree that it should also be formal. But I think it should nevertheless not miss the characteristics of a student organisation. And since this conference is already something formal, why not have a casual luxury buffet so that when people eat, they could somehow feel free, but do not feel like attending something too serious? I also agree with you, that it is impossible to serve finger food, like nibbles and snacks, since it is overall a dinner conference. I think the event could be more animated by doing a buffet? In order to have some changes and to differentiate with the events from previous years?  What do you think?  look forward to hearing from you, Alex
Hello Alex, I am very glad that we already have three of the four issues sorted out! Coming back to the Catering: International three course meal , I am very much aware that the ISA, afterall, is a student organisation. However we are an organisation with formal and professional characteristics. I believe that the young members of the organisation bring in the vivid atmosphere and we, therefore, don't really need to animate them through the catering. From what I saw through experience of the previous years, I think that a buffet would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years, which werenï¿½t even some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversary and thus would harm the prestige of the ISA. Having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. And, as you know, we are trying to 'sell' ourselves to the Russian community and build a strong relationship with them. What do you think about it? Looking forward to hearing back from you, Chris
Hello Christ, Since you have had a lot of experiences from the previous year, I suppose that maybe you should know how big events work. So let's say that we will stay on the international three course meal for the catering. I hope it would work out as we planned.  I am very glad to have the chance to negotiate with you! Thank you for your participation and your spontaneous response! Alex
Dear Chris, I attached my first offer about the open negotiation points. Plese let me know your thoughts about these topics in order to achieve a satisfiable result for either of us. Best regards Alex
Dear Alex,   thank you for your offer. I think too that we can achieve an acceptable agreement for both of us.   First of all good news, Date of Conference: Week 3  works for me too. To the other points:   For both, catering and music act, I think it would be best to stay with the local Russian culture. That way we can show the local people that we respect their tradition. As a bonus all the international guests get a taste of the Russian culture.   I saw that you want the Art Inc. as sponsor. I think itï¿½s a good decision overall but we have to consider the fact that Boomerang is willing to sign a contract to sponsor also upcoming events. To ensure a future based decision I would say that Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   is the more valuable decision.   The last thing I want to talk about are the presentation tasks. Do you have any preferences for that? How about I take the speech and you the awards.   Best regards  Chris
"Dear Chris, I thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Today I analysed your offer and came to the result that we have to negotiate about some points.  Firstly, itï¿½s nice to see we both agree on Date of Conference: Week 3  thatï¿½s fine.  On the second point about the cultue I canï¿½t agree with you. The traditional character of your concept doesnï¿½t fit to the international event. In my opinion we are an international associaton and so the Russian people can show us that they adapt to our culture and fit in an international associaton like us. I think itï¿½s better when we see the new generation of Russian people that is open to the ""Western World"". Therefore I suggest definitely  Catering: International buffet because the dinner should be easy-going, very relaxed and shouldnï¿½t become much attention from the attendees. Furthermore, I really suggest Music Act: DJ Happy since a local band doesnï¿½t fit the character of an international event at all. With DJ Happy we would absolutly reach the audience we are interessted in as ISA. Also I would rather make the speech instead of presentate the awards. I think present the awards would be an great opportunity to come in contact with some important people? On the other side I think a external speaker could be a good alternative because a experienced speaker would raise our chances to win since it would qualitative improve the event. What do you think about that this point? Moreover,  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang isnï¿½t my prefered sponsor because they offer isnï¿½t that high but I kinda like the idea because itï¿½s a safe long term solution. So I concede on this point since it raises our chances to impose the jury by winning that new longterm sponsor! Best regards Alex        "
Dear Alex,   thank you for answering and sharing your preferences with me. You are absolutely right, to satisfy both of us a little bit more negotiation is needed.   The second point which is mainly described in an international versus local issue I understand you point but canï¿½t agree with it because of the following two facts:   1.   We all know that the first attempt of ISA to settle in Russia failed based on different problems. Some of them were related to the fact that the local people didnï¿½t show enough interest because ISA didnï¿½t adapt itself to this new culture. In order to excite the local people and ensure the success we have to do some kind of adaption. 2.   Of course you are right with your argument that we are an international institution, but a part of the success of ISA is based on the balancing between international and local orientation. To continue this success in my opinion it is important to mind that.   As I can see the music and the food decision is important to both of us, therefore I could imagine to do a compromise. In my opinion Dj Happy would overshadow the reputation of ISA because of his degree of popularity. In order to meet your preferences, I could think of changing the local Russian cuisine to an Catering: International three course meal   if we go with a Music Act: Local Russian band   instead of DJ Happy.   The last point to negotiate on, if the offer above is ok for you, are the presentation tasks. My preference here is to make the speech as I already mentioned but if you meet me in the points above I would agree on your offer and do the awards presentation part.   Best regards   Chris
Dear Chris, I canï¿½t agree with you. I still think itï¿½s a bad idea to go with that Russian culture eating. Itï¿½s very kind that you offer me an international three course meal but I really think itï¿½s not the right catering for that event since it would lead to a very static event. So I really demand  Catering: International buffet there isnï¿½t any other possibility for me. On the other side I think I can deal with Music Act: Local Russian band  because I think the impact of the music isnï¿½t that high to the welfare of the people.  Keep in mind that I already made a compromise with  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang Best wishes  Alex
Dear Alex,   Thank you very much for your offer to go with the local Russian band instead of DJ Happy. I understand now that the international buffet is an absolute must have for you. Since you meet my preferences with the band it is ok for me to take the international buffet instead of an other solution.  I think this is a good compromise to attract both the international and the local people. This combination would also have been my next offer. Like I mentioned in my last offer I would prefer the speech but according to the fact that you agreed to Boomerang as sponsor I think its absolutely fair that you can do the speech and I will do the award presenting instead.   Summarized I am very pleased with your offer and accept it gladly. I hope that this solution is satisfactory for both of us and we can go on with the rest of the planning and win the competition.   Thank you for this interesting negotiation and good luck for all your future tasks!   Greetings, Chris
Hi Chris, My name is Alex. Iï¿½m very happy to join with you the organisation contest. Although weï¿½ve never met yet, Iï¿½ve already heard something about you :) We are both long members of ISA, but with a completely different background. I have experience in planning and organising events, that all have been very successful. And I have heard you have knowledge to some business contacts to our partners. Are you in direct contact with the executives as CEOï¿½s? I am looking forward to working with you! Just for your information, I will have to work today from 3 p.m. until 9 p.m. at another event. So donï¿½t wonder if you donï¿½t get a mail from me in that time. Kind regards, Alex
Hi Alex, I am also very pleased that we can work together on this project. I have heard that you are a member of ISA for quite a long time now and the events organized by you were really successful. Fortunately, I have also a lot of experience regarding ISA as well as business world.  I have already got some thoughts on the event, you can see them under the preference label. If you have any idea we can discuss them one by one.  Note: I will be available only from tomorrow morning. Best, Chris
"Hi Chris, thanks for your offer! I think there are a few topics, we need to discuss. First, I think it's a good date you have choosen and agree with it. So, let's fix the date on week 3. First let's talk about the Catering. In my opinion ISA is a student association with its roots in Germany. And this event is primarily the 40th anniverary party with guests from all countries, not only russian guests. So I would like to ofer an international buffet. That creates an open atmosphere. Everyone can talk to each other while going to the buffet and everone can find something he likes. I think the local cuisine is too ""special"" for the most people. Catering: International buffet The next topic I want to talk about is the music act. You suggested a local band. Over the last years, there was an increasing dissatisfaction with the music on our events. I'm sure that a local russian band is not the right choice to change that. In my opinion we are a student organisation and our client base are dynamic students we are looking for. We still want to grow worldwide, so we have to increase our attractiveness to the students. Do you know DJ Happy? He is very popular and fills huge venues. That would definitively upgrade our event! So, I suggest DJ Happy. As you said, we can talk about the topics one by one. So let's talk about the remaining points later. I'm looking forward for your answer. Kind regards, Alex"
Hi Alex, thank you for your remarks, I think you brought up very interesting aspects. However, I am afraid that I disagree with you regarding the importance of establishing a new office in Saint Petersburg. The success of ISA has always been partly due to the successful adoptation of local culture, the athmosphere of the event should thus reflect some local cultural aspect. As I see, the two purpose named the 40th anniversary and establishing  a new office will not necessarily be overshadowing each other so we can express our respect and commitment towards Russia while we create a very enjoyable event for all guests. Thus, my suggestion would be that we keep the balance meaning keep some cultural aspects and drop an other. Regarding music act Local Russian band might not be the most appropriate choice since it is not a well-known band in international circles and therefore does not emphasize enough the importance of the event. However, DJ Happy can be a bit too much and our event will get a side attraction which is not acceptable for us. Do you happen to know the band FreeLife? I think their music is suited to accompany the evening without being the main act and they would probably satisfy most guests. If we drop the russian band and choose an international band instead than we should seriously consider the Russian cuisine. First of all, we need to have a real menu instead of buffet because our guests are very important people who expect a certain level of formality. Anything less than a three course menu would harm of the prestige of the ISA, not to mention that the ISA conferences over the last few years also included more formal menu. This occasion is at the same time a special event being the 40th anniversary so I think this is a good opportunity to make something different and smuggle a little bit russian into it without being too much. As I see, our partners and target audience represent internationality as we do so serving russian food cannot be a problem. What do you think about these proposal? Regarding the sponsor selection I suggest the Boomerang. I have a really good relationship with the company and they are willing to support the event with a very generous amount of money. Moreover, their intention is to start a long-term relationship with ISA which can secure our financial status in the upcoming years. I am looking for your answer! Best,   Chris
Hi Chris,   Iï¿½m happy that we have enough time remaining to discuss and find an agreement which is good for both of us and gives us the chance to plan a unique event together! Thanks for your detailled mail. In my opinion the presentation of the local culture is not inevitably. First it is mainly the anniverary, and because of that the most people will join the event. There will be a few locals, of course, but I think it's more important to show them the international background and professionality of ISA. I want to start with the topic catering, because it's in my opinion a very meaningful criteria. You are right, that there are many important people. But it will be impossible to mix our students and the business people at the tables in such a way that an open communication is possible. And one of the main goals of this event is to match our members and business partners, especially with a few on the new opened subsidiary. I'm still sure that a international buffet will be the right decision. But maybe we can talk about that later and postpone this topic for the moment. I need some time to think about it and maybe to talk to some people of my organisation teams of the last events. I hope that's ok for you? I haven't heard of the band FreeLife before. I will get some information about them until our next mail, ok? Until then I would prefer DJ Happy to the local band. Have you seen the offer of Art Inc? It was much higher than the one of Boomerang. With that hight we can pay a better music act or make a great meal for our guests. That will definitively be more attractive. You are right, that a long-term relationship may be positive, but I see risks with that. If we enter into a long-term contract, we don't have any flexibility any more. And I think it's a wrong sign to our partners, alsways have one company in the foreground. Perhaps that will frighten off possible new partners and sponsors. Do you agree in Art Inc? Just to tell you my favoured option for the presentation task. I like to do the opening ceremony because I'm less connected than you so far and it would be a great chance for me to get the attention of all the present business people. I will be working today till 9 p.m. So I my next mail will receive you tomorrow in the morning. Have a nice day! Alex
Hi Alex, thank you for your answer. As you said we still have enough time to close the deal properly but I think it is time for us to come closer to each otherï¿½a point. For the presentation topic I would also suggest that we do both the opening speech as well as the awards with a little change. I prefer you to make the awards speech which gives you the opportunity to present yourself at the event and get attached to the organization. I would give the opening speech since I am now an ecperienced member who our partners already recognize and trust. In this case both of us get a chance to present ourselves and not least it is the organizationï¿½s best interest too. As I have said before, I would not force the local aspect and I tend to create a more international event but still insist on a little bit of it. I mean, that we should show our commitment towards our new office through the catering or the music. I think it is not overshadow the importance of the anniversary moreover it expresses our open-minded attutude. If we choose an authentic food or music that will not harm to everyone but it gets less likely that we lose our new office which is a crucial point. My offer is that we can choose the Local Russian band and Internatioal three course meal package or the FreeLife and Local Russian cousine package. The sponsorhip question I would leave opened for now. I will think about it later, I might be willing to accept your proposal depending on other subjects. I hope I could come a little closer to your point of view and you will consider the same. Looking for your answer tomorrow. Regards,   Chris
HI Chris! Thanks for your suggestion. I was thinking about our strategy, talking one topic after the other.  I'm sure we both want a high outcome for each of us individually but for organizing a good event we also need a high jointly outcome that creates a good event. I think making compromises in every point one by one will lower our both positions. Maybe we should talk about packages and try out which one fits for us in a good way. I think the topic Catering is a very important one for both of us and taking the compromise with the 3course menu will maybe lower our preferred outcomes for the concept. So what would you say about giving you the local band. You can do the opening speech and for that I get Art Inc and the International Buffet. Hope you like the suggestion of finding a good package together. After all, we are a team (and I think a good one) and I like working together with you. A hard negotiation  that comes to a low outcome for both of us is in my opinion not expedient and especially stressful. Hope you agree with that! I'm looking forward to hearing from you! Alex
Hello Alex! Tkank you for your cooperation. I accept your offer since I think that it is quite a good deal for both of us and we can organize a great event with these conditions.  I am happy that we could work together smoothly and I really enjoyed it! All the best, Chris
Dear Sir or Madam,   the subject of my email is the upcoming ISA event and to let you know that i am your partner. I'm really looking forward to this event and hope you are as eager to win as i am. To get things started we need to discuss different aspects of the conference. I have some suggestions we should talk about:   In my opinion the conference should be a laid back event where everybody feels comfortable and has no problems talking to attending people and meet new contacts. Because of this fact we need an Catering: International buffet   to easily get in touch with other people instead of sitting at the same table for most of the time.   Another point is booking a music act. As you probably know, ISA stands for International Student Association which means we need to attract young people with this conference and therefore have a popular Artist. What do you think about Music Act: DJ Happy  ? Don't you think he will be the perfect fit for our needs?   One of the really important issues is the sponsor selection for me. Because of our longterm relationship and the offered payment for the event Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  would be the ideal sponsor in my eyes.   We also need to discuss the date of the conference. In my opinion, Date of Conference: Week 3  is perfect due to the International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow in Week 1 and the absence of the vice president in week 2. I'm pretty sure you will agree with me on this one.   Last thing would be the presentation tasks. I know i'm confident enough to do the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  . What do you think about this topic?   I look forward to hear from you soon.   Best regards,     Alex
Dear Alex, my name is Chris and I'm looking forward to being your partner for organizing the ISA event.  About the first topic, the catering. I would prefer a local Russian cuisine, because our event is a celebration of the new established subsidiary in Russia, therefore I think adapting the catering to the location would be best. About sitting on the same table the whole time, this is a good point, but there are a lot of important people attending ana a set dinner has a higher level of formality and would fit our event better, I think. But maybe can find a better solution.  Regarding our music act, I have a different opinion as well. The whole event should focus on establishing good relations with Russia, so I would suggest we book a local russian band. In combination with our Russian catering we can show how glad we are  to open a new subsidiary in Russia. Futhermore I worry that such a well known act like DJ Hapyy may overshadow the whole purpose of oure event. What do you thinik? I had Art Inc under consideration as well and they offerd us the most for our event, but I think we should also consider Boomerang. Although  they made a smaller offer, they were willing to sign a long-term contract, which provides some kind of financial security. What do you think ist best for us? Art Inc. covering a larger amount of the event costs, or trying to get a long-term contract. Week 3  is a good idea. I agree totally. I feel confident to do the opening speech as well and would also like to do it, but if we can agree on the local russian cuisine or the musical arrangement, you can do the opening speech if you like.  I am lookin forward to hearing from you and your thoughts on my comments.    best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, thank you for your kind reply. I'm glad you're thinking the same about the Date of Conference: Week 3  as i do. I think we can already skip this topic without any further discussion. But i'm not happy with your point of view about the catering. In my opinion we should really focus on our international operations and therefore offer a Catering: International buffet  for our guests. I understand your concern about the appreciation, so how about booking the Music Act: Local Russian band  instead of having both, a russian meal and a russian band? I think this would satisfy both sides and show appreciation to all our guests. This gets me to my last two issues. I'm with you about the longterm financial aspect and really thought about my choice of sponsor, but i want to stand out with this event so we should get Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  as a sponsor, to do so. Last thing would be the presentation task. If you like to do the opening speech, i'll be fine with doing the awards. So Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  is a good compromise for me. I look forward to hear from you in the near future. With kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, thank you for your quick reply and I am glad we agree on Date of Conference: Week 3 and Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex.   I like your compromise with heaving Music Act: Local Russian band  and an international food. But I still think a set meal would fit our event better, so what do you think about heaving Catering: International three course meal With this option we can show our international operations and have a more formal dinner than with the buffet. What do you think? If we go with the Catering: International three course meal I would agree on heaving Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. With the higher captial for our event we can arrange a nice dinner that will satisfy everyone. I hope you like my idea and looking forward to hearing from you. Best Regards, Chris   
Dear Chris, thank you for your latest offer but its not that satisfying for me. I think we should really do the Catering: International buffet  and have a Music Act: Local Russian band  to show our appreciation. You can do the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  and i was thinking about the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  as you suggested in one of your offers. Please let me know what you think. Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, I really like your proposal. Let's got with Catering: International buffet  and take Sponsor Selection: Boomerang instead of ArtInc.  It was nice negotating with you and I am sure our event will be good. With best regards, Chris
Good morning dear Chris, how are you? I hope everything is fine. The previous week I have been so busy, but now I am ready to completely focus on our task for the ISA Competition. Even if we still have time, I think that we should begin to discuss the main issue now. We have lot to discuss about, don't we? In particular, I analyzed what concerns  Catering: International buffet , Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  Those are whta, in my personal opinion would make the event spcial. In details, International buffet and Dj Happy would give that international/young atmosphere I am looking for.  Moreover, I think third week would be suitable (no other events or Christmas closeness). Concerning the sponsor, Art Inc is our most important partner, we should sign a deal with them in order to mantain a long-term relationship. Last but not least, we have the occasion to show our skills: you with your great personality would be the perfect one to handle awards, while with my long lasting experience in ISA I could make one of the initial speeches. What do you think about it? Do you agree with me?  Alex
"Good afternoon dear Alex, I'm fine, thank you, and you? We have much to disscuss about, but we don't have much time. I'd like to beginn with the Music Act: Local Russian band   I think that the music act is an easy way to show ISAï¿½s interest in the Russian culture and therefore i plan on having a local Russian band as the music act. In my prior discussion, i proposed DJ Happy, a very famous international music star, and a quite well-known pop band called FreeLife. I know that these music acts would probably be more attractive, especially for the younger generation, but i think the strategy of the event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with local companies and officials. I think that DJ Happy is the worst option since there is no guarantee that his reputation would not overshadow the reputation of the ISA, distracting attention from the event towards the music act. I have heard about festivals with DJ Happy as the performer and I canï¿½t imagine to have ISA as a ï¿½side-actï¿½ to DJ Happy.  The next issue which has to be discussed is the Catering: local Russian cuisine I think that local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. In any case, i must have a real menu and not some kind of buffet, since i expect many important people to be there who expect a certain level of formality! Therefore, I think that anything less than a three course meal would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years, which werenï¿½t even some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversary and thus would harm the prestige of the ISA. I would really dislike having a buffet at the conference. Having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes! The next issue is Date of Conference: Week 5   The longer, the better:) Then comes the issue Presentation Tasks: Third person   I have joined the ISA in 2010 in the context of a student internship at one of the business partners of ISA. Since then, i cooperated with business contacts of ISA in order to help organising internships for other students on a voluntary basis and there-fore have gained profound knowledge about these business contacts and their interests. As i know, you has joined the ISA as a student member in 2009 when you started studying. you has some experience in the planning of smaller events which were always very successful. As far as i know Alex never had the chance to tackle a project this big. I can't understand why you choose the option ""Speech by Alex and awards by Chris""???If i have more experice than you on the big event, and you get the speech, i'd like to choose the option---third person. It's fair. About the Sponsor Selection: No Selection , i have no idea, please just tell me your priority! Then i will make a decision! Please don't forget the keyword of our event---""Russian""! In order to have a successfully event, please speak it with me 3 most important points: ""Russia, Russia, and Russia""! The most important thing for me is the date of coference, it must be 5 weeks. Please tell me if it is possible. sincerely yours Chris"
Good afternoon Chris I've just read your proposals. Actually, we have different opinions but we surely work on it and find a solution suitable for both of us! At first regarding the Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  , since you do not have particular preferences, we should contact Art Inc. Not only they made the best offer, but also they have been ISA partners for many years, and continuing our partnership with them would definetely worth it. Next, regarding the Date of Conference: Week 3  I think that week 5 would be too late! Consider that at week 5 Christmas is so close, it won't be suitable for all our guests! I understand that you are a bit concerned because of the lack of time but week 3 is not so close and we can definetely do it working hard together. The other important issue is the Catering: International buffet  . We are in Russia, it's right, but remember that our guests are students and business people from all over the world! ISA means INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ASSOCIATION, and our main target is to satisfy our guests. What better than international food? Moreover, I think that formality could be addressed also in a buffet. It is a formal occasion, you are right, but we have also to remember that in such occasion people would like to create and expand their networks and acquaintances. In fact, we need to create a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. For what concerns the Music Act: DJ Happy  ,  I realized, in the previous years, a great dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts at ISA events. Having a local band, fitting the tastes only of Russians, is not the best for an international association's meeting.  Regarding the Presentation Tasks: Third person  I would have liked to make a speech regarding my long-lasting experience with ISA. And, even if we barely know each other, I realized that you could have the right charisma for the awards By the way, I agree with you that a third person would also be suitable, especially if we hire someone important and well-known. Tell me what you think and your proposals, I am looking forward to read them!  Alex  
"Good afternoon Alex, Thank you for your replying! You said that we have to find a solution suitable for both of us, but what I see below was just your opinion. So here is my opinion, with our different opinions we have to find a ""middle idea"" between us.  Catering: local Russian cuisine   You are right, we are a international group. But just imagine, when you go to Russia for a travel, which kind of food do you want the best? Will you choose the food from your hometown or a traditional food? Do you want to eat German food in Russia? It will definitely untasting and much more expensive! I actually donï¿½t want a German food which made by a Russia cooker. Date of Conference: Week 5   Week 5 is near the Christmas, but, it's not IN the Christmas. It's valiable! Music Act: Local Russian band   As i said, event is the more important thing than a music band. We have an event of ISA instead of a concert, right? DJ Happy is really the worst choice!! Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   That is my opinion. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   As my experience, i'm absolutely convinced that the smaller amount of money spent by spon-sor Boomerang is balanced by the offer of a long-term contract which would ensure some financial security. Thus, i prefer sponsor Boomerang over Art Inc.. Without a written contract regarding the future, Art Inc. can always decide to change their intentions.  That is my proposal and how will we find a ""middle way""? My opnion is that we should just build a math model instead of a long useless blabla talk to solve this problem because i know no matter what i said you will still insist on your opinion and the same situation on me. Chris"
"Good afternoon Chris, I have just read your proposal. I am sorry to realize that you are upset for my previous offer. My intention was not to impose my point of view but just to explain what I think regarding every issue! Now that we both know (more or less) what are our ideas, we should start finding our ""middle earth"" agreement. I do not agree with you regarding the mathematical schema instead of what you call ""blabla"", I think we should continue our discussion for another couple of days, before the mere math. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex For me a third person would be better but also this option could be doable... But given that I accept this, what about having  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  ? I consider Art Inc the best option for ISA, and the choice that could let we win the competition.  At first let's talk about those two issues and than move to the others. We are in the same boat, our goal is to organize the event as better as possible in order to win the competition and I would like to find an agreement that could satisfy the both of us. Alex"
Hi Alex, Sorry for the late responding.  Here is my offer.  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Please tell me if it is ok for you. And here are the rest offers. Catering: local Russian cuisine   If you let me choose the right food, you can deside the date of  conference you like. Date of Conference: No Selection   We will discuss about the music act tomorrow. I wil be very very busy on Friday, so we have to make a deal tomorrow.   Chris
Good evening Chris, do not worry, I can imagine, it is a busy period of the year, as usual! Regarding your proposal, I think we are agreeing on some common fields but I thought another one. My main issue reguards  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. and I would be grateful if you accept it.  On the other hand, I see that catering is so important for you, so  Catering: local Russian cuisine  and  Date of Conference: Week 3  . For the presentation, as you wrote, Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  . For the music, what about a middle-earth agreement with  Music Act: FreeLife  ?  I think that would be ok for both of us, as far as catering would be totally Russian and Music not by DJHappy (as you said, you think it wouldn't be so good. I am looking forward to hear from you, Alex
"Hi Alex, Thanks for replying! I can accept that we make 1 step backwards each, which means, i won't insist on date of conference and you won't insist on the catering. Of course it is also and even more important that i can have a date of conference in week 5, but I would still like to confirm this deal. So Catering: local Russian cuisine  and Date of Conference: Week 3  are fix.   But i can't accept another 3 options, because none of these 3 options are my ideal choice! For me it is also the sponsor selection the most important thing(from all 5 options even!) and i insist on the choice""boomerang or Documenta"". About music act i think the local Russian band is the only right choice for me. Of course for the presentation tasks it will be better, that i can have the opening speech. In order to solve this prolem, i suggest that someone has to make a step backwards on Sponsor selecton(which is the most important thing for both of us) and at the same time another one has to make a step backward on the Presentation tasks and music act. Maybe you have some idea?     Looking forward for your apply! Chris"
Dear Chris, sorry for my late answer.  That is what I think I will let you have the  Catering: local Russian cuisine  . For me that is the WORST option, worst at all! But i accept it, in exchange of  Date of Conference: Week 3   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  . Those are not the best for you, I know, but are not also the worst! I accepted the worst catering, but my three issues could also be fine for you (i repeat, i accepted a 0 utility with catering, so just try to compromise...) For the Music art, the  Music Act: FreeLife  is the right compromise. In this offer I am giving you a lot, I completely let you decide the catering (a very important issue!). Waiting for your answer, Alex
Hi Alex, The week 3 is also my worst option! I also let you decide the date of conference! Right??? Loss and gain, that is the negotiation! Because about the Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  is my worst choice, i can't confirm your offer. As i said, i won't have any time on Friday, just to remind.   Chris
Dear Chris, I understood you are busy on Friday, you've already said it to me in another message.  Regarding your offers, there are things quite unclear. Since the beginning I fairly negotiated with you, using disclosure. I specified that my priorities are Sponsor Selection and Catering. On the other hand, you were not as clear. Indeed in the first email you said you did not have preferences regarding the partner, but later when I proposed Art.inc, you suddenly changed your mind prefering Boomerang... Moreover, for the Date of the Conference you said the later it is, the better would be for you: Week 3 is later than Week 1 or Week 2, so I think that it wouldn't be the worst option for you as you said. Just to summarize, i accepted THE WORST for catering, while you accepted Sponsor and Date of the Conference (not the best, but not the worst for your utility). Now you decided THE WORST for me reguarding music while I have proposed a middle earth agreement... nevertheless also proposed speech by you and awards by me!! Sorry but this is not fair-play. My offer is that i give you THE WORST for catering (MY SECONDO MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE), in exchange for NOT the WORST for you reguarding sponsor and date. Music middle-earth and Speech better for YOU. This is a fair offer, we both know that. We should close the deal and end the negotiation. Alex
"Hi Alex, If you say like that""i accepted THE WORST for catering, while you accepted Sponsor and Date of the Conference"", i find it just like wasting of our time. Because you know that i lose more than you in this deal. It's not a fair play. The later, the better, right , but it doesn't means that week5>week4>3>2>1, my mistake, but hope you can understand that. week 3 is my worst. I just find that explaining about my worst is just a waste of time because i will NEVER cheat you! I have to go now and will be back later. Chris "
"Hi Chris, I do not know your utility numbers, we are negotiating and I base what I say on what you write. Check your previous mails, regarding the Sponsor Selection and the Date of the conference. There has been clear changes of idea by your side (I am not in your mind, I base my assumptions on what I read). Now you seem upse and angry, chill out and relax a little please. As far as you made the last proposal because you were upset, I will propose you that again.  Please, consider it carefully this time. Sponsor and Date better for me; Catering and Presentetion for you. Music middle-earth. That is fair. You could say whatever you want but those are FACTS. Have a nice day.  "
Hi Alex, Sorry for my late replying. I wasn't sure about the sponsor because i haven't read it before. There are 5 topics, I choose 2 of them, and you can decide the rest of those 3(including your and my most important issue ï¿½Sponsorï¿½). So it can be (and must be) like this: Catering: local Russian cuisine  My advantage Date of Conference: Week 3  Your advantage Music Act: Local Russian band  My advantage Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  Your advantage Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  Your advantage, and our most important issue   You are a really nice negotiator. You prepared a lot, with strict logic. But I really donï¿½t have time on Friday, so Iï¿½d like you to have a little bit advantage in order that we can  deal this in the end of this today.I've done my best efforts, but if you donï¿½t accept this, I can't break my deadline to accept this, i will veto the negotiation then.     Chris
Dear Chris, I see you made efforts in your last offer. I hope that our little argument is over now, and that we can collaborate also in the future.  I think you've reached an utility higher than mine (I have 66%) but I consider more important to close the deal and try to win the competition together as a team. Good night
Dear Chris, I'm very excited for having the opportunity to organize this year anniversary event and I'm confident that we can come up with something really special by working together. Attached you can find my first offer. I look forward to hearing from you, Alex. Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: No Selection  Catering: International buffet   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  
Hei Alex, let's make an awesome event an win this competition :) Nice proposal yours...but you know, we are going to do the event it in Russia and they are usually super proud of their country, what do you think to make it a bit more typical russian so we get their love? :) We could make russian music and russian food...what's better than people dancing with a full belly?  Waiting for your answer i wish you a nice afternoon, Chris  
"Dear Chris,   thank you for your quickly response. I understand your position, but I have some remarks to make.   Even if itï¿½s true that Russian are very proud of their country , I am afraid that not everyone is familiar with the Russian cuisine, so Iï¿½m worried that they not all the guests may like the typical Russian food. Wouldnï¿½t it be better to have a more international mixture, to be sure that everyone can find something of their taste?   In addition, Iï¿½m concerned about the choice of music. Having a local band playing at the event doesnï¿½t seem to fit the international character of our organization; also having a more famous music guest could attract more attention to the event. For those reasons I believe it would be better to go for a more famous performer : if not DJ Happy, we could go for Free Life.   The last issues I would like to discuss with you is the presentation task.  Because I have some experience in organizing event like this (that have always turned out to be really successfu), I believe that it would be fair for me to do the opening speech and you could assign this yearï¿½s awards.   I hope to hear from you soon,   Alex.   Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  "
Hei alex, mmm I understand your point about music. I would like to think about possible issues with FreeLife but for the moment let's say ok.  Uh the last time i forgot to write you. What do you think about the 5th week? Can be really nice make it around christmas! :) The food i don't know, When you go in another country you are always open to try local food, and in case you know, Russia kitchen is mainly based on potatoes, fish and chicken,... no one can really say that think is disgusting food. xD About the presentation i like that you are confident about yourself, but you know i'm in ISA since a bit and i think i'm able to make proper presentation. What do you think about share the presentation?  Have a nice day meanwhile, Davide
Dear Chris, I donï¿½t think that the 5th week of December is going to work: it is really close to Christmas and I believe that a lot of people wouldnï¿½t be able to attend our event. Everyone would be super busy organizing their holidays and some may already have left to go back home. Also, I believe they will prefer to spend this time of the year together with their family and loved ones instead of attending an event like ours.  As long as food is concerned, I believe that not everyone would enjoy trying new type of food. Some people are really not open minded in those terms and they prefer to have food they are sure to like. Plus, with an international buffet, people can walk around while eating and that would help to have a nice and relax atmosphere. Our association is an international one after all, so why not to have international food? For the presentation task, I believe to be fully capable of making a good speech and I proposed myself to do the introduction speech beacuse I know that you have more knowledge and experience in dealing with our business contacts, rather than organizing events. Maybe it would be better to hire an external person. If we can hire someone of high profile to talk about the importance of our organization, I think it could be really beneficial and put both of us in a good light. Finally, in my opinion our best option in term of sponsor is Art Inc. They did make the best offer in terms of money directly for our event after all. I hope you have a good evening, Alex. Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Third person   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  
But exactly because it is christmas everybody would have time for a nicely relaxing evening of interaction with us.  Uh I saw the poposal of Art Inc...but you know Boomerang made a longer-term proposal. Even if we get a bit more from Art Inc. now, what will be about the future? About food, exactly because we are international people we must be open to new experience...ISA wants to fit in culutre, right? And the third person can acutally sounds good!....who do you have in mind? I would feel not too safe to give such an important speech to someone i don't trust a lot.    But wait...we are alost fighting...this is not the way a cool organization shoul work, we should be a nice team which organize together right? :) So, what do you think about this proposal i submit...it takes a bit o both so we can make a cool event.    p.s. Let you make the starting speech it's a bit difficult to accept, but it's a proof of trust :P Have a nice day,  Davide
Dear Chris,   donï¿½t worry, we are not fighting, ust disagreeing on some issues. I believe that in organizing an event important like ours, this is totally normal.   For the sponsor selection, I see your point on Boomerang. They pay a little bit less than Art. Inc. but they are willing to sing a long term contract with ISA, so that could help the organization to have more financial security in the future and in the organization of upcoming events. On the other hand however, Art. Inc has always supported us, so I canï¿½t see a reason why they should stop doing that in the future. But youï¿½re right, we should organize this event together and try to find some sort of comprise: youï¿½ve been really collaborating so far, so I believe I can concede you Boomerang.   For the cuisine matter, I really believe that the local food is not going to work. I donï¿½t think local specialities fit our multi - international event. So what do you think of a three course meal? Itï¿½s really formal and everybody will have to sit and talk with the same people for several hours, but at least everyone will be satisfied with the food choices.   I really appreciate your faith in me and your decision to leave me the opening speech. I will do my best to prepare a beautiful speech and not let you down.I also believe you're going to do a great work with the awards assignment.      I really hope we can find an agreement   Alex.

Dear Alex, I like your spirit of collaboration and I feel we are almost to an agreement, i lï¿½ke it! Before accept your final offer i would like howevwer to put something typcal of the local culture in the event. Since it seems you are not open at all for the food, can i propose a compromise? We make your international buffet, but the music is from the local band...can it work? Have a nice evening,  chris
Dear Chris, I believe we have found an agreement! I'm happy we were able to find a comprimse that satisfies both of us. I think we can really organize a great event that will put both of us in a goog light. It's been a pleasure working with you, Alex.
Hello Chris, I hope you are doing great!! How are things going? I'm really looking forward to organize the event together with you in a team. I'm pretty sure that our team is able to win this competition as we can perfectly complement each other. Regarding the organization of the event I thought about some open points: I think the points Catering: International buffet  and Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  are very clear for both of us and we don't need to discuss them further. When we have a look at the calendar, week 3 is the best time period for the Date of Conference: Week 3  as there are the fewest overlaps with other important dates, what do you think? Concerning the Music Act: DJ Happy : In my opinion DJ Happy fits best to our event. So I would choose him! One very important open question is the presentation tasks we have to do in a team. For me, it would be also fine to hold the speech in order to lighten your workload a little bit, if you can do the negotiation with Art Inc. regarding the sponsoring in return. I think you have greater experience in terms of business relations and I can easily speak in front of a crowd. That would perfectly fit our skills. Have a great day! Kind regards, Alex
Hello Alex, I am doing well. Thanks for asking. How about you? I am so content that we are going to work as a team for organizing the event about which I hope we can do our best in both our individual and team performance. I, also, would like to inform you that I have analyzed your offer, which seemed to me a bit less comprimesable than I had expected. For that reason I would like to highlight some aspects on which we should put some more considirations. I think that Catering: local Russian cuisine  is going to be ideal for this type of event since the organization has decided to combine both the debut of the small subsidiaries that are located in Russia and the 40th anniversary.  I also think that the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  would be the best case scnerio for the future of the organization due to their offer. Since the music is always going to take the big chunk of the event I think that combining the local Russian cuisine with the Music Act: Local Russian band   would pretty much satisfy all of our visitors. I have to tell you that picking out Date of Conference: Week 3  is going to be well fit with the event so I agree with you on that point. Your notion about me having a lot of work-load is not necessarily important since the event that is going to take place in Russia will be crucial and we are highly expected to put our best performance to  contribute to the event. Having said that, I would be delighted to tell you that I desire to share the presentation with you in order to be given the same tasks to work as a team. Have a nice day! Kind regards, Chris  
Hi Chris, I'm also doing great, thanks! Regarding the catering, we should definitely stick to the international buffet as we want to ensure that people can network easily on the conference. Therefore we need a nice easy-going atmosphere. The most important aspect we have to keep in mind is that people come froem all over the world and we need to provide a huge variety of food to assure that everybody can find something what he/she likes! Only the minority of gests will be familiar with local Russian food. I think this point is not negotiable because the theree course meal does not fit the atmosphere and offering just Russian food would be a desaster for the whole conference. Boomerang is a good sponsor but I think Art Inc. would be even more benefitial for us! Why do you think Boomerang is the best sponsor for the future? I think Art Inc. and ISA have a long tradition together and we shouldn't end that relationship by changing to the competitor of Art Inc. Regarding the music act, I planned to have a more international band playing. We should at least have freelife if we don't book DJ Happy who is one of the most famous international DJs. The speech can be also held by you, if you want to. Then I can do the awards. For me it doesn't matter, if you want to make the speech or I do. But together is no option for me because I think that is firstly too complicated to coordinate it and secondly, it is just more fluently for the procedure, if there is just one person who holds the speech. Alternatively, if that is no solution for you, a third person would also work for me. I'm sure when we do it this way, we have a great plan for the conference. I'm already really excited about the upcoming event. It will be just great! Have a nice evening! Bye, Alex          
Dear Alex, I am so deligtful to tell you that the suggestions you came up with really intrigued me.  It was, also, a decent opportunity for me to cooperate with you as a team. I hope we are going to have some other events to organize in the future. Kind regards, Chris
Hello Chris, how are you? I would like to discuss the oranisation issues we still have to plan.  First of all I'd like to discuss the Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. . I think this is the best choice as they offered a high short-term payment for the event. Additionally there will be a representative of the company at our event so we could benefit from his presentation during the event because this may attract new members as they see that a well-known company is sponsoring the ISA event. Secondly, I'd like to talk about the Catering: International buffet . I think it would be best to have a buffet where everyone has the possibility to talk to everybody during the meal and not just sitting at the table during a menue. This would be beneficial for everyone as you can get in contact to many different members of ISA. The buffet would help to get a relaxed atmosphere. And I think international food is a much better choice than Russian food as Russian food is quite specific and not everyone's taste. As it is an international association I think this is the best choice to make everyone find something they like. The Date of Conference: Week 3  would be the best as Christmas holidays is still far ahead. And in the weeks before it wouldn't be a good idea as the Conference on Economics and Business Management takes place in Moskow (week 1) and in week 2 there are important members of ISA not able to come. As I recognized on events in the last years the music wasn't satisfactory for the audience... Did you recognize this as well? So I propose to choose Music Act: DJ Happy  as he is a famous international performer and he has plenty of experience in perfoming. This would also fit best to the International Student Association as there are many members from all over the world and an international actor would be satisfactory for everyone. Last but not least I would propose myself for the speech as I already have experience in holding speeches. You could give the awards so everyone of us is once in the focus which would be good for our reputation. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Thank you in advance for your good coorperation and I am looking forward to receiving an answer from you. Best regards Alex
Dear Alex, thank you very much for your first offer. I'm sure we will find a solution for our remaining issues. First of all I would agree on the  Date of Conference: Week 3 , which is perfect for me too. As we - ISA - are opening a new subsidiary in Russia, the conference will attract many Russian companies, public figures and other business people. Therefore I think our event should reflect some cultural aspects from our future business partners in Russia. In my opinion, the easiest way to realise this is Catering: local Russian cuisine  and Music Act: Local Russian band . Furthermore I would suggest to choose Sponsor Selection: Boomerang , as Boomerang made a very good offer too. We would get only slightly less money then from Art Inc. for our conference. However they are interested in signing a long-term contract, which means ISA would profit more from a long-term perspective when choosing Boomerang. I would prefer to keep the speech during the conference too, however I'm also fine with Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   if you could make some concessions to the previous issues. I'm sure we will find a good agreement creating a grandiose event. I'm looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerly Chris
Hello Chris,   thanks for your answer and thank you to let me hold the speech. I would accept your offer for the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang . Additionally I would make a concession in Music Act: Local Russian band  if we could have a Catering: International buffet . I think you made good points to reflect cultural aspects of Russia due to new business partners. But I think it is enough to reflect it through the music as it will be played the whole night. So we continuously have a Russian flair throughout the event. As ISA is an international organisation with members from all over the world it would be great to have international food so every nationality can be reflected in the buffet. Furthermore I am sure we can talk to the caterer to add some Russian specialities. Would you be okay with that? I am looking forward to receiving an answer! Have a nice evening. Best regards Alex
Dear Alex, thank you for your last offer. As I think we found a good compromise for all of our issues I'll accept this offer. Both of us made some concessions and in my opinion we found a very good agreement for both of us, making the conference an amazing event. See you soon! Yours sincerly Chris
Dear Chris, I hope this email finds you well. I am really exited to work with you on organizing the ISA conference. I hope we will have a great time together and the outcome will satisfy both of us. In the appendix you can see my preferences for the activities. I hope our preferences match and we will find a quick solution.   Best regards, Alex
Hello Alex, I hope you are well too. I am also excited to work on this conference together. Since the conference is for the first time held in Russia, I think it is better for the future business partners, and the new members and guests, to show better appreciation of the russian culture. Therefore as a catering option as well as Musical act, I suggest we stick to local cuisine and music. This way I think we will show the new members and guests that they are important to us.  About the sponsor selection, Art inc. is a good sponsor with a great offer, but in my oppinion I think we should go with the long term solution for sponsorship, so in the future conferences we dont have to search for new sponsors.  I hope this terms are acceptable to you, and we can conclude this negotiations. Sincerely, Chris
Hello Chris, Sorry for my late answer but I had a very stressful business day. I am happy to see that we agree on the 3rd week as the date for the conference. I understand that you want to show that we appreciate the Russian culture. Nevertheless I believe that the Russian culture is quite different from the culture of the western world. This can definitely be seen in food and music.  I believe that a lot of guests are not familiar with the Russian cuisine and I am not quite sure if the taste of the Russian cuisine matches the taste of the majority of the guests. Since for example porridge, solyanka, rassolnik and ucha are traditional Russian dishes and beet, cabbage, as well as onions and garlic are frequent ingredients. I am not sure if every person will like this kind of food. Therefore Russian cuisine might not be a good choice for all guests. As the event will last for several hours the food catering is essential for a good atmosphere to avoid that anyone needs to hunger. Therefore I still recommend having a wide international mixture of food that is known and eaten worldwide. To show our appreciation of the Russian culture we could also offer Russian cuisine as a part of the buffet.  Regarding the music act I have the same doubts as with the catering. I fear that not every guest will like the Russian music. As this international event should be one of a kind we also need a one of a kind international music act. Therefore I strongly recommend going for DJ Happy as a Music Act. His Performance will also attract international guests and companies, as he is well known amongst a lot of people. Since he has such an immense success all over the world I assume that the guests will also like his music.  Regarding the sponsorship I understand that a long partnership gives us stability and helps to plan for the future, nevertheless we will need a lot of money, which is necessary to ensure liquidity during the planning phase. Further by choosing Boomerang as a sponsor we are committing ourselves for a long time relation ship, which could reduce our flexibility in planning. As Art. Inc. is already a long time supporter I believe that even without a binding contract Art Inc. will support us on future projects. And still ensures our flexibility. Therefore I would recommend to stick to Art Inc.  Best Regards, Alex
Hello Alex, I am also happy that we agreed on the 3rd week for the conference. From my previous experience, the success of the ISA conferences has always been partialy due to successful adoption of local culture. Therefore I am sure that also this time that will be the case. If we show the Russians (which are a bit closed market) that we can appreciate their culture and music, I think the conference will be a success and we will gain a lot from it. Yes, some of their foods are different that most people are used to them, but still they have great dishes and there can be found something for everyone.  About the music act, again, I think the main goal of the conference that is being held in Russia is to make future contacts and business partners. So I am sugesting to go with the local Russian band. DJ Happy is a great choice, and a very famous DJ, but in my oppinion he doesnï¿½t fit the goal of the conference quite right. The conference shouldnï¿½t be a side act to DJ Happy, it should be vice versa.  About the Sponsor selection, Art Inc. is a long time supporter, but they can change their minds for the next conference, and without it we will have problems that with Boomerang as a sponsor wont exist. Art Inc. would have been perfect if they can guarantee a long term relationship. The Boomerang offer is slightly less than Art Inc. but with the promise of a long term contract, this will pay off definitely. Please think about my suggestions about the russian culture, because at the end of the day I think this kind of model will pay off for both of us, as well as for the ISA organisation.  Best, Chris  
Hello Chris, As I see in our last negotiation round we did not get any further, I think we have to make some compromises, as we have to finish our discussion within the next two days. I understand that you want to have a Russian touch in this event. As I think having two Russian parts is too much I can agree on having one Russian part of the event. My offer is that I will give in on the music act and we will have the local Russian band, in return I would like you to agree on the international cuisine for the catering. I think this is a very good deal for you and will satisfy your request to have a Russian part in the event. I hope this will lead to a consensus that satisfies both of us.  About the Sponsor selection, Art Inc. is a long time supporter, and therefore I think they will continuo to be our supporter in the future, I donï¿½t see any threats here. Even in the unlikely event that Art Inc. will not be available I am sure that we will find another sponsored for further evens. Therefore I still recommend going for the higher sponsoring and Art Inc. I also reconsidered the presentation task and I think that it would be best to have a third person to hold the opening speech. Since it would be a high coordination effort for both of us. Further it would give us the opportunity to focus on other tasks. Best regards, Alex
Hello Alex, Yes I also think we should make compromises. Dont you think itï¿½s better to go with the international three course meal, because for an event like this I think is more apropriate then a buffet. About the presentation task, itï¿½s not a problem for me to give the opening speech. And I dont think it will be time consuming for you to give away the awards.  For the sponsor I still think that we should go with the long term option, but if you agree on the other points, I think we can make it work with Art Inc. Best regards,  Chris
Dear Chris, I read your answer to my last offer with great interest, but unfortunately I cannot accept certain issues. Having a very formal three-course meal where everybody sits down for several hours with the same people goes completely against that idea of an open international atmosphere. If I have to agree on the local Russian band I have to insist on having the international buffet. Regarding the sponsoring. I see that you are interested in doing the opening speech I am willing to let you do the opening speech in contrast we will agree on Art Inc. as an sponsor. This is a great offer since it will be a great opportunity to gain a lot of attention, which will support your future. Best Regards, Alex
Hello Alex, About the presentation tasks, you gave them up, so since you dont want to do them, i do. Itï¿½s better some publicity than none. We can go with art inc. as a sponsor, if you consider the international 3 course meal as a catering option. Best regards, Chris  
Hey Chris, Considering the effort we have already put in this negotiation and due to the soon to come deadline I want to bring this negotiation to a soon end and therefore I am making a final offer. The cuisine will be an international buffet as I already gave in on the Russian music. I will give up Art Inc. as a sponsor and we will go for Boomerang so you will get your first preference here. As a compensation for that I want to do the opening speech. I fear this is the best compromise I can do. Now it is up to you to decide. Hope to find a good solution. Best Regards, Alex
Hi Alex, I will accept your offer! It was nice negotiating with you, and I hope you are satisfied from the outcome of the negotiation. Best wishes, Chris
Hello Chris, hereby I would like to take the opportunity of submitting some proposals for the organisation of the upcoming ISA event. Regarding the music act I was thinking about engaging DJ Happy, who is a rather international artist and therefore in my opinion very fitting for an event organized by the ISA. Respective the selection of the sponsor for the event I propose to consider Art Inc. as official sponsor for the event. Another very important issue for us to solve is the date on which the event shall take place. Therefor I propose the third week of the 5-week timeframe that was given to us by the ISA. Regarding the catering of the event I suggest going with a buffet consisting of different international dishes, I am looking forward to our continued good cooperation and your view on my above given proposals regarding the organisation of the event.   Best regards Alex
Hi Alex, Well that's some formality right there, very neat. I'm sort of in a hurry right now, so I'll go through your message and offer tomorrow and then we can discuss the rest. Is that alright? regards chris
Hello Chris, thanks for the information and the quick answer. Best regards Alex
Hi Alex, I finally found the time to go through your messages and offer and it sure looks neat, I don't think we'll have a lot to discuss for this one. I've still got a few open question however, so let's start in the beginning. Catering, you suggested an internation buffet, I'd assume for the same reason you suggested DJ Happy (because it's international right?) but you should keep in mind that the even is being held in Russia and the goal should be to keep up a good appearance and impress our Russian partners. I'd strongly suggest local Russian cuisine so we could impress them with formality and the people would get the feeling that we appreciate their culture. You know how conservative Russia still is, if internationality was your only reason for the buffet, then we should definitely switch to the local cuisine. And honestly, same goes for the Music Act. I mean I get it, he's popular with the young folks and international and all but Alex really, still Russia we're speaking of and still older business partners. I'll be frank, I'm really scared DJ Happy will be so entertaining that the whole ISA event will only remain as a background event and people would only focus on the DJ. Our target group for th event really shouldnt be youngsters but the older folks, don't you agree? The other offers looks more or less fine to me. I mean, I'm a person I'll always find something to nag about, but I guess if the catering and music act are fine, I can live fine with your other choices. Hope I wasn't too hard you, really, I like working with you! I'm looking forward to your message, have a nice evening regards
  Hello Chris,   I am pleased that we agree on most points of the offer.     Regarding the catering, however, I think here are a few more thoughts needed.   It is true that a strict Russian cuisine would make a good impression on the Russian guests and business partners. And I also understand your thought, that totally ignoring their culture would have an negative impact on the ISA. However, we must consider that the event is primarily held because of the anniversary if the ISA, which means that in addition to the Russian partners certainly many other guests from all over the world will be present. I, personally, like to eat Russian food, but maybe not all the guests are familiar with the Russian cuisine, which rather is a bit special. And as much as we want to impress our local partners, the interests of the remaining guests should not be neglected, and I think we shouldn't specialize exclusively on the Russian guests.   With an buffet consisting of international mixed food there is the option of adding some Russian dishes to it as well as specialties of other cultures. By adding some Russian dishes we can acknowledge the culture of our local guest and additionally leave it to the remaining guests to decide whether to try the local dishes or go with something else instead.     Speaking of internationality, I think we should stick to that with the music act as well. I agree with you that maybe DJHappy isn't the best choice because of his popularity. I hadn't thought of the fact that the event could lose it's main focus when engaging DJHappy. But I totally share your opinion here.   So I would propose engaging the international band FreeLife. I think the band won't just cover the taste of the young people as much as a DJ. And with the fact that the band is also known in many countries we can be sure that not only the taste of one part of our guests will be met.   FreeLife isn't as popular as DJHappy so I think by going with this band, the main focus of the event will still be celebrating the anniversary of the ISA as well as getting to know our Russian partners, and not the music act itself.        I hope you could follow my arguments and I am looking forward to your point of view.      Have a nice day!       Regards   Alex  
"Hi Alex, Yeah, I mean I guess follow your arguments but I'd be really unhappy if we don't show appreciation for their culture at all. Serving a few dishes on a whole international buffet is like saying ""we don't give a single fuck about your culture but it would be rude not to serve anything"". Listen I really would be thankful if we can agree on at one of those two (Music Act or Catering) being about the Russian culture. Personally I'd prefer if we could agree on the Catering being Russian then you can go with DJ Happy if you really need to. But I'd be ready to let you choose in ths one. In any case one of those two needs to be Russian, you can't just not include the culture at all. I'm ready to let you choose. regards chris"
Hi Chris, I honestly wouldn't say that serving russian food as part of an international buffet will mean that we don't acknowledge the russian culture at all - in my opinion it's a compromising solution with which you can make sure that all participating guests can find something likeable to eat. But I understand your point to include the russian culture in some way. So I would rather go with the international buffet and the russian local band because I think in this matter it's more important to meet with everyone's taste regarding the food. And by choosing the russian music act I think our russian partners really will appreciate us respecting their culture. I hope to hear from you soon, regards Alex
Hi Alex, Awesome! Then at least we've settled on the Catering and the Music Act for now. Looks like we're getting closer to a goal. Also I'd agree with the Date of the Conferece, so only things left are Presentation Tasks and Sponsor Selection. About the sponsor selection i know that Art Inc has offered to donate slightly more so I'd assume that's why you proposed them. I mean I'd really suggest to at least take Boomerang at least into consideration because, yes it's true they offered a bit less, but they would sign a long-term contract assuring future financing for ISA. And wel about the presentation tasks, I'd of course also want to hld the speech. It's the opening speech and more glamorous and all. But I'd be ready to give he speech to you if you can agree on Boomerang on the sponsor. If you really insit on Art Inc. I'd like to hear your reasons, but I'd go along with it if you therefor let me hold the opening speech. Anyway it's up to you. I changed the Sponsor Selection for now but if you'd rather give me the speech just send me the counter offer. We're getting close to an end. :) Looking forward to your answer.   regards, chris
  Hello Chris,     Well I thought you'd said that you agreed on my offers regarding the remaining points.   But let's have a closer look here:   I didn't just propose Art Inc. as sponsor because of their high offer. I think that it would be the best thing to go with them because they support the ISA for a long time now. Going with their direct competitor Boomerang could result in Art Inc. not supporting the ISA  in the future anymore, which we should avoid in my opinion - so I hope you can understand why I rather would go with Art Inc.   In exchange for that it would be okay for me if you held the opening speech and I present the awards.     Well then I think now we have a satisfying agreement on all of the points.   I'm looking forward to your answer.       Regards   Alex  
Fine by me! :) Glad we've decided on everything. Regards
Hello Chris,  my detailed offer is listed below: - Catering: International buffet   - Date of Conference: Week 3   - Music Act: FreeLife   - Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   - Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Kind regards, Alex  
Hi Alex, thanks for the e-mail. Could you tell me more about the FeeLife band and why you prefer a international buffet?   Best regards, Chris
"Dear Chris   Firstly, I thought about inviting DJ Happy, he is very famous performer.In case he may not come, I thought about FreeLife pop group. In my opinion, this band is also very good. Yes, this group is not famous as Dj Happy, nevertheless I hope guest will be satisfied with their performance. About catering; I think International buffet will be very good for all guests, because at the ceremony there will be many guests from overseas and perhaps. That is way, it is good making international buffet: everybody will be able to find meal which he or she likes. I hope you are agree with me   Kind regars, Alex "
Dear Alex, thanks for the quick reply. In my oppionion our goal is to create and improve the relationships of ISA with the russian local companies since we try to establish a subsidiary in Saint Petersburg. Therefore I would suggest, that we shift the motto to a more russian base one. This would be a russion cuisine and a russian band in my opinion. Is there a reason why you dislike the idea? Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I am really sorry for replying your e-mail late. As I wrote on my last e-mail, this ceremony will be celebrated widely, because it is 40th anneversary of ISA. That is way, many guests from overseas will visit this ceremony. So, I think it will be better to make an international buffet for visitors, because everybody has diffirent taste of meal. From an international buffet you can find different types of meal such as meal for vegetarians, meal for muslims and so on,but about national russian foods I am not quite sure that it will be suitable for all visitors. The next issue, Music Act. I would prefer FreeLife pop group, because this group is both good and well-known among people. What do you think about it? Thank you! Kind regadrs, Alex 
Dear Alex, since I have the feeling, that package deals might be better for us, this is my offer. On the Date of the conference we might agree from the start. But we have to talk about the catering and the band desicion.   Best regards,Chris
Dear Chris,   No, Chris, I am sorry,but I am not agree with you about catering and Music Act. Please, just think  international buffet and Freelife will be very perfect Kind regards, Alex
Hi Alex, sry, but the international Buffet is unexptable for me. Our first goal should be to establish a subsidiary in Russia. The first try didn't work that well. I think, that we need strong business parter for ISA. In my opionin a local russion cuisine would be the best pick to get those.   Best regards,Chris
Hi Chris,  I am really sorry for replying you so late.  Well, Chris just one time believe me. International buffet will bring us many pluses. About sponser selection I am agree with choosing Boomirang Kind regards, Alex  
Dear Alex, to trust you on the topic of the catering I have to ask you a few important questions. I know that you have planed some smaller projects and they were succesfully. But why are you participating on the competition? Since this question is very personally I will answer it too. I have worked for ISA for 5 years. It was always a pleasure to do this. Because I have done many cooperations with business contacts of ISA I think that I have profound knowledge about their interests. Please tell me why should we have an international Buffet instead a local Russion Cuisine?   best regards, Chris
Dear Chris,    As I mentioned on my previous E-Mails, it is a very big ceremony. I can tell you two reasons for choosing only international buffet: 1. Firstly, the ceremony should be liked by the visitors. For this we have to pay attention more their meal. Just imagine, want you to dance or celebrate something when you are hungry? If the visitors cannot find the meal which is suitable for them, then, they will not able to feel well. Of course, due to this their mood will not be good either. 2. Secondly, guests will be abe to get familiar with another nations' food, it is also good for our ceremony. Another point is, it is an international buffet and it means people will be able to find Russian national meal from international buffet. So, what do you think about it?   Kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, I trust you on your catering desicion. I look forward to realize our planed ISA conference, if we get picked. If we don't get picked, i want to tell you, that it was a pleasure to negotiate with you.   Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris, I am sure we can find a good deal together to reach a great team score and get that prize! I think for this we should try to reach an agreement quickly and efficiently. Therefore let me explain my thoughts behind the attached offer. For catering only an international buffet makes sense. As it is an internation event for networking local food might be not to the liking of everyone and a sit down meal is just not flexible enough, people should be free to move around. The best date for the conference is in the third week. All others have conflicts with things like christmas or in the second week in which the ISA vice president and others are not available, which would probably reflect badly on our team score if we upset them. For music I think we should take DJ Happy. We are after all a student organisation so we should try to be as interesting to them as possible. With many great students the companies will automatically be interested in us. That is the way we got big, I think we really should stick with that model. Also being an international star as with the food it will probably be to the liking of everyone. For the sponsor I would suggest Art Inc. They have been our patron for a while and have made the best offer. I would not want to upset them and lose money by chosing someone else! Lastly I would love to hold the opening speech. I do not know you yet so I cannot judge if you are the speech holding type or how your experience is in that field but I am definitely offering. This is I feel very strongly about the catering and the sponsor. It would of course be great if you find this acceptable. If you have any further questions go ahead and ask. I am eager to hear your response and your reasonings!   Kind Regards, Alex
Dear Alex,  I would also like to reach a great team score, but I can't say I agree with your proposal, so here is my counteroffer accompanied with my explanation and wishes: Firstly, for the catering, I would really dislike having a buffet, as the event will be more formal and we are expecting important Russian guests. To show our appreciation, I believe it would be best to serve local Russian cuisine. For the date of the conference, I also don't agree, but as this is my least important point (14%), I am willing to make a concession and I agree to week 3. Next is the music, which I similarly to the cousine, believe should be local Russian, as this event's primary purpouse is to make our Russian members comfortable, and we can use DJ Happy on other events. Art Inc. did make the best offer in terms of short-term payment and I do realise they have donated to us in the past, but we do not have a binding contract, so I am concerned about the future. Whereas Boomerang is offering us slightly less money for this event, but they are willing to sign a long-term contract, so even if we did upset Art Inc, it would not be so terrible, as a written contract is always more tangible and secure. Last but not least, I aswell would like to hold the openning speech very much. With that being said, here is my offer. I am looking forward to your reply! Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris, Thanks for the quick reply! It is great that we could agree on the Date from the beginning. From my side I would be willing to let you do the opening speech and I could also live with Boomerang as a sponsor but be aware that i am giving up my most important point. I would like to have you therefor accept the international buffet and the DJ Happy, or if it suits you more we could use Freelife as a medium concession. I just think on our first large international event from an international organisation we should have food and music that caters to everybody and not just the local businesses. Think about who will be evaluationg our result. If they dislike the food and music choice they will not only be bored but also hungry which will refect badly on us! Kind Regards, Alex
Dear Alex,  thank you for your quick replys aswell, sorry I didn't reply asap, as I was not home. I thought about the sponsor and if it really is that important to you (it is my top priority aswell), I would be willing to accept Art Inc, if I could have the local Russian cousine and the local Russian band. I agree that we should not let the people evaluating us get bored. Russian culture is beautiful and our evaluators would get a taste of its rich and tasteful history through music and cousine. I think it would be great for both of us. And don't worry about them being bored, russian events and parties are considered one of the most vibrant if the locals are comfortable enough!  What do you think? Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris, thanks again, I think we are getting closer to an agreement. How about we split the food and music issue between us? I get an international buffet and you get the Russian band? The food is for me a more important point than the music so I hope you are OK with doing it this way rather than the other. I am sorry but I cannot give you both the music and the food. But i can give you other concessions maybe. I will make 2 other suggestions based on my current offer: You said week 3 is not your favorite. I would concede that point if you prefer week 4. The other weeks would seem strange to me if you refer them so this is a guess on my side. The other possibility is that we take Boomerang instead of Art Inc. but therefore I get the opening speach. These two are just about the same for me and slightly worse than the offer I sent you now. Please let me know which one suits you most.   Kind regards, Alex
Hey Alex, I like your thinking, but the problem is that using the international buffet yealds a very close to zero utility for me, so having that instead of the music would be better for me aswell. So I think it would be best if I chose your option two with a slight adjustment. I propose the following: I get the Boomerang and give you the openning speech, you get week 3, and for the music and the best I can do for the cousine is the following: an international 3 course meal, or keep the buffet, but I get the speech. These two give me the same utility, what do you think? Best Regards, Chris
Hi Alex, I did not quite understand your last message, you missed something about the music which makes it unclear to me. Do I assume correctly that in both cases we will have russian music? If yes then I much prefer your second model, but let me right in down to make sure we are on the same page: Sponsor: Boomerang Music: Russian Opening Speech: You (me doing the awards) Week: 3 Food: International buffet The thing is that going for the 3 course meal is only marginally better for me, that is not much gain in it if we choose that over Russian food. But I am sorry I would insist on having the opening speech in that case. For me that would make it exactly the middle between your original proposal and my original one. But I did come up with another alternative. Maybe you check if that gives you an advantage. It is attached here. It even yields slightly less than the one above with me giving the speech so I hope it would be better for you then and we therefor can agree on it without having to strongarm each other about who will give the opening speech! Kind regards, Alex
Hi Alex, sorry for not responding sooner, but I was already asleep. As I said, both of these options were the same to me, so you chosing my second option is fine by me. My second option is also better for me than your alternative, so I am sending you this offer so we can make the agreement. I am so glad we were this efficient! Best regards, Chris
Hi Chris, You missed in thing of my last message. I said I would insist on making the opening speech myself in this case. I mean you made one big concession with the Food like I did with the Music but I also made a large concession on the Sponsor whereas you admittedly only made a small one for the date. Therefor I think it would be fair if I also get the speech. Like I said this would be exactly the middle for me between your and my original offer!   Kind Regards, Alex
Hey Alex I understood that you in the second case want to have the speech, not in this case. Anyway, I accept this offer, it was great fun negotiating! Bes regards, Chris
Hello Chris,   Here is my offer for the event, I studied all the possibilities and I think that this combination will guarantee the best for our audience.   Best regards, Alex.
Dear Alex, In order to get a qualified job and get recognition in ISA cooperation, we must change some aspects for our planning, to make sure that we can win the competition being the best performing team of ISA. My proposal to benefit both of us we could organise the event is as follows:   Catering: Local Russian cuisine as we want a good impression to the formalized companies or at least a International three course meal. We must show to the companies a good image of how important we are. A simple buffet would mean a cheap impression of the benefits that the companies can reach.   Music Act: DJ Happy does not seem the best option, will distract our event and our propose of catching new russian companies. The people could think that it's somehow a celebration/party instead of an event. For that I would prefer Local Russian band to attract them in their ambient or at least Pop band FreeLife to have a confortable ambient. Date of Conference: Week 3 in December would be the best option or also Week 4 which is near to the Christmas holidays and everybody will be able to atend during this period. Week 1 could be also fine but has the inconvenient that it's in the same date as the biggest business conference in Russia which, were many companies will not be able to attend and we don't want to miss them! Week 2 doesn't seems a good option because some of the ISA's higher ranked persons like the vice president will not be able to attend during this week so no evaluation from their side could be done and would mean inconsideration to them.   Presentation tasks: I think the speech is a better option for me as I have a high experience introducing big events and therefore I achieved many formal companies to join ISA which means a high value to the whole organisation and chances to explain with more detail our records. Sponsor selection: Art Inc. could be fine but think about Boomerang, they can support us in a long term and not only to pay the costs of the event. This means that wi'll be able to pay many future expenses that could be essential in our future plan. I look forward to make a reasonable agreement. In case that you feel in disagree in some aspects, I would suggest to allow me to make some decisions to make it easier, allow me to decide for the sponsor, presentation task and music act as I have a high experience dealing with big events which were succesful in the past convincing in a formalized way people to join to our internship program. Any suggestions that you can provide me will be welcome so we can cope organising this event. Tell me which are your preferences because of your also high experience! Wishing all the best, Chris.  
Dear Chris, I have thought about your preferences and yes, maybe some changes could improve the quality of the event, but I think that some of them should be discarded. Lets see the different parts of the organization: Catering: the international buffet will have also Russian food. In addition, I had participated in a lot of luxury and business events and in all of them the catering is a buffet of food a drink, I can send you references if you need them. Music Act: DJ Happy is a very famous performer, he regularly fills huge venues with his events and his presence will attract many guests, giving us a lot of promo. This kind of music is attractive for people between 18-40 years old, and take in mind that the business man that are interested in our company are usually young and our company is not a Russian company, so that kind of music does not represent us. Date of Conference: Maybe we can talk about this point later, I have some information about an event in the city that week, but perhaps it won't interfere. Presentation Task:  I am really motivated about this event and I have experience as speaker in business and sports events, so, I would want to open the speech. If for you this is a personal problem, we could think about choose a third person. Sponsor Selection: some years ago we tried to enter un Russia and we were not successful, and Art Inc. is going to make a bigger payment. Remember that if this event is successful we will have more funding and in the long term we will have more money than the amount that Art Inc. and Boomerang can offer us.   Wishing all the best, Alex.
Hi Alex, My counteroffer is as follows. Taking care of what you said I think it's fair for both of us. My high experience in organizing big events will not defraud you so please allow me to take the speech and decide at least for Pop band FreeLife in case you totally disagree with Russian local band. I know that DJ Happy is really well know dj and will attract many people but we will also distract the event in something else and therefore it's not the most convenient. For the sponsor is ok we could get Art Inc. and for the conference would be better on Week 1 as companies can also bring some members while the Russian business conference takes place. For the catering if you think russian cuisine is not the best we may take the international three course meal so it looks a bit more professional as in my past events formal meals attract more the companies and international buffets were only done to celebrate awards between ISA members.
Hi Chris, I analyzed your arguments and they look very reasonable. About the music I think as you that Freelife can be a good option, and thank you for agreeing Art Inc. as our sponsor. I can admit that the week 3 is a good date for the event. Also I asked to some colleagues and they declared that you have a lot of experience in presentations as you said, so, I will be happy to let you the speech in the event if you accept the international buffet for the catering. I continue thinking that an international buffet it is better. The idea for the catering is to give a better atmosphere and facilitate networking. Having a three course meal everybody will sit down for several hours with the same people, and this goes completely against the objective. If you accept this offer we can continue working in other tasks -like your speech. It is one of the most important taks in the event!- we have a lot of work to do. Best regards, Alex.
Hi Alex, Thanks for your good impression and I totally agree with this offer. To make it final, I would like to make the speech about ISA's best records. I already know to say from my past events. I am pretty sure wi'll have the best team performance having both a qualified job (I already spoke with internal presidents who mentioned directly to me those rewards) after this successful event. Please confirm me as final offer and whishing to win this team challenge! :) Bests, Chris.
Dear Chris, I have attached some deals which i find appropriate for our concern. May you accept it as a beneficiary boundary for both of us. best Regards, alex
Dear Alex, Thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, i cannot agree with all your terms. I can see your point of view, but i don't think that all these ideas ar in the benefit of ISA. I think that with the preferences from this counteroffer, we can achieve a good relationship with more Russian companies: I think that the Russian culture should play an important role in this event: Catering: local Russian cuisine    Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   I think that the date of the conference should be better in week 3, but week 4 is not so bad either.  Date of Conference: Week 3   For the long term i think that Bommerang is a better sponsor than Art Inc.  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang     I wish you a nice evening, Chris     
dear chris, I think we have to considerate on international food because we have a lot of international people so we have to satisfy them i want your consideration on this part. i think we dont have any problem with dates and on music part it should be at least FREELIFE It can show at least some english version but i think it would be best if we have selected DJ. I can be flexible with you from my side so SPEECH BY CHRIS AND AWARDS BY ALEX but please we have to be with some genuine partner Art Inc. which would be the best sponser for us. Hope you have find a very attractive deal and make our deal more fruitful. Yours, alex....
Dear Alex, After some reflections on your last offer, I think that we can agree with some parts of your last offer. I can agree with the Art Inc. as a sponsor like you proposed, but i still think that the Boomerang is a better choise. Therefor, i need you to take into consideration my opinion about the Russian culture. To impress more the Russian partners, I need at last to insist to have a local Russian cuisine and a local Russian band. In this event we need to concentrated us on the Russian companys and investors. I hope that this offer is attractive for you too. Yours, Chris  
dear chris, it was very hard to make a decision on your favor regarding the music after a long assessment i support your argument so we can manage LOCAL RUSSIAN BAND but i cant be against of INTERNATIONAL BUFFET, because we will have many kind of delegates from various countries and needed to coperate with them honestly. if some people  would like to taste russian they can go to russian restaurant after a day but mass deals with international people so we need to concern them, lets not make them upset. on the other hand you said to favor russians but i think they already have a taste of their own food, no need of any exaggeration. eventually, i would recommend you to deal in this beautiful offers. regards 
Dear Alex, I took your proposal regarding the international people who are attending the event. So, I agree on the internatational food but at least it should be an international three course meal.This three course meal has been an important tradition concerning ISA's events. I agree with the rest of the offer. I hope that this offer can suit both of us to be able to reach an agreement.  Regards, Chris
Dear Chris, i dont think that it is possible for me to go with other options besides international buffet and if you are happy with internnational three course meal then you have to consider on other two options in music and presentation task. so its all upon you and waiting to hear your desicion soon.  thankyou alex
Dear Alex, I have analyzed your new offer. I have chosen the inernational three course meal as a middle way for both of us because in reality i think that the local Russian cuisine is the best choise. If for you is so important the international buffet i am willing to accept this offer and give you the speech too but in return i would like you to consider the Boomerang as a sponsor. I hope that this new choises are a good deal for you too. Regards, Chris
hey chris, ok i agree on boomerang but is it possible to make music DJ or FREELIFE. It may make our negotiation close other wise its quite difficult i find. alex
Dear Alex, i looked again over our discussions and i think that the best deal for both of us is the one from yesterday. I am willing to give you the international buffet as you asked. I hope that like this we can come now to an agreement.  Yours, Chris
dear chris, some how i am satisfied with that deal but we have to come to an end so, i agree on that for our benefits and its nice to have a fair negotiation and i hope to have a good coffee some time and again marry chrismas and enjoy a days ahead. Alex
Dear Alex, i am happy that we come to a final agreement and i realy think that this deal is a goot choise for both of us. Marry chrismas to you too and hope to meet you soon in person.  Yours, Chris
Hello Chris, How are you? I just wanted to remind you that we have to talk about some urgent topics regarding the organization of the annual ISA conference in St. Petersburg. We are short in time, so I think we should speed up a bit otherwise we wonï¿½t be able to organize everything on time. I think with your profound knowledge of ISA and your business contacts and my motivation and vision we will be able to arange something great this year. Please reach ASAP out to me. Looking forward talking to you. Best regards Alex
"Hi Alex,  thank you for your message. Together with message, I was expecting and offer but you did not send it. You can set it in this right panel ""Counteroffer"". Therefore I send you mine! We could start with this. I think this is very fair and smart option. Let me know what do you think so we can negotiate about it.  Kind regards, Chris "
Hi Chris, thanks your fast reply. Well, i thought we should first talk about some general issues I have with the ISA conference and your experience. What do you think abour Dr. Illenschitz? Do you know some of his preferences we should think about while organizing the conference? I heard that he is not a big fan of the local Russian cuisine, did you know that? A guy of ISA told me also that he can get really mad if we chose not his prefered sponsor because of some sort of unwritten agreement he has with one them. We should be really carefull with this issue if we want to win this competition. Cheers, Alex
Hi Alex,  I really like what your wrote me. We donï¿½t want to have problems with people  lik Mr. Illenshitz, so I guess international three course meal should be fine. Can you tell me more about that sponsor that Mr. Illenshitz preffer? Kind regards, Chris 
Hi Chris, Iï¿½ll answer some of your questions here, as I want to include also some facts I think we should change in your proposal.  Let us just clarify shortly the Date of Conferece. Iï¿½m not sure if week 3 is really a good option. Why do you want this week and not week 2, 4 or even 5? And the music? Really a local russian band? I understand your point of view, that you want to incorporate russian culture with the ISA conference but I think itï¿½s time to put the conference in a new format. More attracting to young talents, loaded with more energy and the spirit of the new generation of leaders. As you hopefully know by yourself the young people are more attracted into some elektronical music, deep house and nice vibes instead of a boring local russian band with their trumpets, guitars and balalaika. We should definitely go for some other option. I know a good DJ, I will ask him if he is interested. You should be fine with that. What is your experience with the food? How did you do that the last years? Donï¿½t you think a three course meal is too formal? We should think about that later on. That remindes me of a boring business banquet, where all the brown-nosers will try to sit next to the important business persons. This is not what we want to achieve with the conference. We want people to interact and talk to each other to build up relations and network. What do you think makes you a good speaker at the conference? Have you ever considered to give this to a third person, let me do the job or to share the activities? We could arrange an interesting russian business tycon to do this. In that way we can attract the young leaders even more for our conference. I will try to get some more informations regarding the sponsor selection. Once I know more I will let you know. Regards Alex  
"Hi Alex,  thank you for your message.  Weeks 4 and 5 are too close to Christmass. On the other hand, I am not sure are you familiar with it but for the second week, some of ISAï¿½s higher ranked members ï¿½ among others, the organisationï¿½s vice presidentï¿½ are unavailable and therefore would not be able to join the event. Their presence is not absolutely necessary, but it would be inconsiderate to make plans for this timeslot knowing that they would be unable to attend. Therefore, I think third week is the best solution for everybody.  About music, you might be right. Russian band could be a problem, but on the other hand, DJ Happy is world star. I donï¿½t want that people come there only because of him and to make our event ""side-act"". Letï¿½s choose FreeLife. They are cool but still not that famous to put us in a shadow.  About food, I just can not accept international buffet. I want to have a real menu and not some kind of buffet, since we expect many important people to be there who expect a certain level of formality. Therefore, I think that anything less than a three course meal would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years, which werenï¿½t even some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversary and thus would harm the prestige of the ISA. Interesting Russian business taycon? That could be really cool solution for a speaker. I like it. We need something at least somebody to promote Russia.  About sponsors, I preffer Boomerang because I am absolutely convinced that the smaller amount of money spent by sponsor Boomerang is balanced by the offer of a long-term contract which would ensure some financial security. Therefor I preffer them in comparison with others.  Kind regards, Alen"
Hi Chris, youï¿½re right we canï¿½t do it in week 2. Week 4 and 5 are also kind of impractical. So letï¿½s agree on week 3. Regarding the music act I really think we should book the DJ. We want to attract as many young talents as possible. The DJ can suppoert us as he will do also some advertisment for the event. He can reach a lot of people through his business channels, which will increase our publicity. You might be right with what you said about the catering. However, our mission is to connect business people with young talents and with the ISA. We should foster this by creating a nice atmosphere where itï¿½s easy for them to interact. With the formal int. three course meal we donï¿½t create this atmosphere and lose a lot of time. It will take about 1,5 - 2 hours untile the meal is completed. During this time people can not talk, which I consider a dead time. With the buffet this will not happen as people can eat, walk around and talk to each other. By the way as it is a promotion conference we donï¿½t need to be that formal. Hmm not sure if Boomerang is the right sponsor. As we open a new market we will need some more money to do that. Of course small amount of money with a log-term contract is interesting but have you ever thought abour the risk of running out of money? By selecting a sponsor who gives us a large ammount of money we will be able to push into the market. We have to be fast as there are maybe also some other organizations who might be interested in Russia. We have to be a pioneer and go fast for all talents. This consideres a large ammount of money but we need it immediately. For this reason Art Inc. would better fit better to our current needs. Let me know what you think. Alex  
Hi Alex,  as I said before, we must keep some professional level, especially now, on our 40th anniversary. International buffet is just a standard for it. Also, DJ happy is just too big star. I donï¿½t want that people come just because of him. ISA conference must not be in the shadow. About sponsor, for it is important to have financial stability in the next period. I donï¿½t want to gamble with the ISA future. Yes, Boomerang gives less money, but for longer period. Knowing that we are financially stable, give us enough space and time for other activities.  Kind regards, Chris
Chris, as I said I understand your point of view and Iï¿½m totally in line with you regarding the standard and level we want to keep. I understand your concern regarding DJ Happy but he wonï¿½t be playing the whole time. The time before his performance will be our time and the conference will be in the spotlight. With his music the conference will be more casual and will support the networking part. I think we should be open to new things and try it this time with DJ Happy. Sponsorship is really important and I think itï¿½s not a gamble if we go with Art Inc. It gives the money and freedom we need to focus fully on the Russian Market. We will have to do a lot advertisment, speeches at universities and will have to travel a lot. We definitely need a large ammount of money in our hands otherwise I see the risk for the ISA of failing again in Russia. We should be the persons who made it happen in Russia. A lot of companies want to sponsor us because through us they get more attraktive for the young talents. Finding in the futere new sponsor wonï¿½t be difficult for us.  Cheers! Alex      
Hi Alex,  let's close this negotiations. I agree with international buffet and with DJ Happy, but I can not accept risk of non accepting Boomerang as our main sponsor. The economy is unstable and it would be irresponsible to play with the future of our organziation.  Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, this sounds good to me. This will be the best ISA conference which ever took place and we will totally convince Mr. Illenschitz about our concept. As you made some concession with the catering, music and presentation I can live with selecting Boomerang as our sponsor. Iï¿½m not totally happy with Boomerang but as I donï¿½t want you to have concerns about our financial stability Iï¿½m fine with it. Thanks and see you soon. Alex  
"Dear Chris, Itï¿½s Alex. Unfortunately, we never met in person but I heard a lot of good things about you. So Iï¿½m really looking forward to organise the 40th anniversary of ISA with you. I think we are a strong team because of the combination of your experience with our business contacts and my organisation skills for events. First of all, we should find a date for the event. Attached you can find a short overview about some conflicts in the available weeks: Week1: International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow Week2: Conference of some higher ranked members of ISA like our vice president Week3: free Week4: free (one week before Christmas) Week5: around Christmas These are only the conflicts, I know about. Do you know something more and what do you suggest? First of all it is important that we pursue the same objective in organising this event. So I would strongly recommend that we focus on the 40th anniversary of ISA and our international, open-minded student character combined with our professionalism. This is how we can convince our business partners from our core-values (international high potentials) and stick to our roots as a student organisation. To combine these characters, I would suggest an international buffet. So everybody can see our internationality combined with an open-minded atmosphere. It would be something special for our local business partners to taste international food; they can eat Russian food everywhere in their region. And if they want to have something from Russia, we can make a ï¿½Russian cornerï¿½ at the international buffet to show our closeness to our new subsidiary and our Russian partners. Also we can have german food in memory of our roots in Constance, where we were founded. During a buffet everybody can talk to different people and donï¿½t have to sit close to only a few people. So everybody can meet different business partners and students and make new contacts. Do you agree with that point? To complete this idea, I would suggest either the Pop band FreeLife or DJ Happy. Which one fits better for you? Now I would like to talk about our sponsor selection. This is very important for me. Art Inc. made the best financial offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event. In addition, we were working many years together with them and I have never heard about problems of our partnership. So I really would go for this offer and get them as our sponsor; this is really important for me! In the end we should decide who is doing the presentation. Do you want to have the opening speech or should I make it? Then the other part could hand over the awards. If we share both activities this would lead to a big confusion and everybody would think of a messed up organization of this event. So I would suggest to make the opening speech; but feel free to change it to your name. Iï¿½m looking forward hearing from you and working together with you. Best regards, Alex"
Dear Alex,  So nice to see your message.  I'm so excited about the organisation for 40th anniversary of ISA with you too.  First of all, i have seen the dates conflicts for the event and i think exactly like you, i think 3rd week would be the best week for the event to take a place. For the next step, for the Catering, i think it would be better for us to respect the cultural of the country that last time when we wanted to open an office there was not succesful and to do so, i thought of Local Russian Cousine to make us three course meal but when i heard your idea, i kind of like it but i think it would be better for our sign of perspective to be more professional by choosing catring as an International three course meal.  As i said before, because of the last time incidence of oppening an office in Moscow that failed, and to be more professinal and respectful to Russian Cultures and Local Companies, i think of some local music band to show them a good relationship otherwise we would go under the shadow of DJs like DJ HAPPY or the other one.  For presentation tasks , i know that it would be so great for each of us to do speech and as you said also doing it together (sharing it) would be not professional at all. I would like always to do speech for my future but as i already want the change of music art , i'll accept your offer for it would be also an honor for me to give the awards.  For sponsor selection , i have heard and seen the good relationship that we have with Art. Int. but there is a problem with them which they don't write a contract and for the future they could change their intention, so i think it's better to be certain about the future by choosing Boomerang even though they would donate less that Art. Int.  It's so great to work with you Alex. Best regards,  Chris
"Dear Chris, Puh changing the music act to the local Russian band has a big impact on the whole event. It has a big effect on the mood of everybody: the students, business partners and so on. So I would agree to that, if we chose the international buffet. Then we are doing both: we are giving our business partners the feeling of home and let everybody know that we identify ourselves with Russia --> Russian music. And we can show them that we are an international organization with young, open-minded professionals and they can easily get in touch with our students --> international buffet. I think that would be the best deal for everybody! Furthermore, I can understand your thoughts for the sponsor selection. But to be honest, the most important thing for both of us is to get as much money as possible; because we can invest this money in our event and make it even better with that. For example, we could invest it in the Russian band or in the buffet. So we get even more and better things to let this evening be legendary. On the other side, we have the responsibility to choose a suitable partner for ISA. We have worked so many years with Art. Int., so they exactly know our core-values and what we are thinking. We would have the same contact person like the last few years and because of that we save a lot of time for getting to know each other. And the most important fact is, that we can rely on our partner and we do not have any uncertainty regarding a new partner. And you have to think positive: after we organized this event, there are even more companies thinking about to work with us and there could be some more and better offers for a partnership; from a Russian company as well. So I definitely would choose the reliable partnership with Art. Int. I think we are already very close with our idea about the event and I hope that we can get together with my attached offer. After that we have more time to prepare our concept presentation to convince everybody. By the way: what are your plans after this event? Are you already searching a job or are you also interested in working for ISA? Best regards Alex"
Dear Alex, As you said we are already close to make an incridible point that both of us being happy with the terms.  I don't know about International Buffet for catering but if you think it would be a good idea then let it be as an International Buffet. About our sponsor as you said also Art. Inc. would be great as they give us good money for all our programs but we wouldn't be sure of the future with them and being sure is very important while with companies like Boomerang for the next conferences we would be sure of the sponsor but with Art. Inc. we wouldn't.  but in this case also if you are insist of giving them the sponsorship then i would like to ask you to let me present the speech and you give the awards.  All and all i think always to work in ISA for better future for myself. What about you ?
"Dear Chris, Like you have seen at my response time: it is hard for me to decide. I had to sleep on it for a night. Is there really no possibility that you accept my previous offer. There I have already done some concessions but it would have been acceptable for me. I would really appreciate if you could somehow make this compromise for me; and for our team! Best regards, Alex"
Dear Alex, I have tried so hard to accept all the terms that you told me and this is not more in my authority to do so or better to say when i accept your last offer i will lose everything. So i ask you to accept this offer or let be Boomerang the sponser while i will definitely lose everything. As a colleague i ask you please. With best regards Chris
Dear Chris,   for the sake of our trustful partnership, I will accept the offer.   I am looking forward meeting you in person.   Best regards, Alex
"Hello Chris, nice to ""meet"" you ;-) Allow me to give you a short introduction of myself. My name is Alex and I am a student member of ISA since 2009. I already planned and organisied some events for ISA, with success ;-) But unfortunately I never saw or met you on the last events. I am really interested in getting to know you better. I think there are still some open points we should negotiate about for the event. You can find my suggestions attached. I am looking forward hearing from and a hope for a good and succesfull negotiation ;-) Best regards, Alex    "
Hey,what do you think about my offer? I think it is the best solution to have local stuff, because people are already familiar with them and they we enjoy it.
Hello Chris, thank you for your answer. For other events and companies I would agree with you and prefer local stuff aswell. But espacially for the ISA, which is an international company since 1967 and due to being the 40th anniversary we can expect a lot of international guests. So I think, it is the best to have an international buffet. The advantage would be, that everyone will find something and I think that a lot of people arn't used to the russian cuisine. For the music act I think the same way. The people got bored more and more in the last years at the events, because the music acts weren't good. For the 40th anniversary we should really have someone famous, like DJ Happy. I am sure everyone will enjoy his music and we will get a good athmosphere. People will talk a lot about this event! I can agree with you to hold the event 1 week earlier than I suggested. Regarding the sponsor, I also thought about Boomerang, they made a really nice offer. But to be honost with you, I would prefere Art Inc. They have been our sponsor for a long time now and they also made the best offer! If we now chose another sponsor for the big 40th anniversary, they could stop sponsoring us at all. And I would really understand that, because as I mentioned before, they are our sponsor for a long time now and if they won't get the sponsoring of our big event, that could impact us badly. The last point is the presentation tasks. I first thought, that we could share the activities, but now as I rethink about it, that could be a lot of coordination work and I don't know if it is that good if we change all the time. Therefore I would suggest, that I hold the opening speech and you will have the honor to announce the award winners.   Please give me your opinion on my counteroffer. Until then with best regards, Alex
Hello Alex, I mostly agree with the your offer, but I would like to change food that people will be eating. I think that we should use local food specialities. I think that people nowadays like to try some different food than one that they are eating every day. When I personaly go to some other country, I like to try some local food because it is also a part of exploring that country. They might be very suprised with some local dishes. What do you think about that? Best regards, Chris
"Hello Chris, thank you for response. I really appreciate our agreement on the most items. Thank you for your accomodation!! But to be honost with you, I can't agree on the local food. If it wasn't the 40th anniversary of the ISA, we could go for that option, but as the event will be something really big with a lot of people all over the world, we should not try to ""play"" with the catering. The food is the base of a good event. And if we choose the local russian catering and the people won't like it, then the event will most likely leed to discomfort of the guests and therefore it might result in an image damage for the whole ISA, but it will also have an huge and bad impact on the career of both of us. As we are responsible for the organisation, everything will come back to us.. Therefore I kindly ask you to overthink that point again. If this event becomes successfully, we will both get the credits for that! That means that we will get the chance to organize more and more events and we will also be recognized by the guest companies. So please, think about the catering again. I am sure, that we can get an agreement on this too! The negotiation was very successefull so far and I really like you as my partner! Until then with best regards, Alex"
Hello Alex, it is okey,I accept your conditions for the event. It was really nice to negotiation with you and I hope that we will do it again soon. Best regards, Chris
Hey Chris,  I'm writing to you regarding our plans for the anniversary. Do you have any preferences regarding the Catering, Date, Presentattion, Music and Sponsor?    I would prefer Art Inc. as a Sponsor for the event, because the ISA already has a great and long running relationship to the Art Inc. Company and they also do offer the highest amount of money. Also they could be offended by choosing a competing Sponsor, which will probably change their opinion about supporting the ISA in the future. I look forward to hear from you.  Best wishes Alex
Hi Alex! Thank you for your message, i'm glad to hear from you. Regarding the Sponsor of the Event, i personally would prefer to choose Boomerang. For sure they don't offer the highest amount of money but we should show that we are not only signing contracts because of money. Furthermore Boomerang seems to be willing to sign a long-term contract. That means that we don't need to negotiate with a new (or the old) sponsor each time we want to host an event. If you change your opinion on that, i maybe would be ready to give you some advantage at one of the other issues? Best wishes Chris
Hey Chris,  sorry for my late response. My Mail did not seem to work. I'm also very glad to hear from you.  Concerning the Sponsorship you have good arguments, nevertheless I think it is more important to show our loyalty to a already good business partner and not jeopardize this long lasting relationship because of a contract with a competetor.  As this would also diminish the reputation of the ISA.  Maybe we could find a compromise by saying that you could do the speech at the presentation tasks and that I will give out the awards? Did you get a chance to think about the other open points and what option you would prefer?  I look forward to hear from you,  Best wishes  Alex  
Hi Alex! It would be no problem for me to agree with your suggestions on the Sponsor and the Presentation Tasks if you also agree with my suggestion regarding the Music Act. My recommendation would be to invite a Local Russian Band to show our new partner our interest and respect on their culture. Especially because the first attempt to open an office in Moscow, in 2004, failed, we should be as careful as possible. So we would be on the safe side. Best wishes Chris
Hey Chris,  Yes, I understand what you mean. Do you think it is possible to have two Music Acts? I just have some concerns with the local russian band, because it is such an international Event and I am not sure if this special kind of music will appeal to everybody. I would be willing to agree on a little different arrangement including the catering.  Considering the catering I think it is reasonable to do a International Buffet. For once the guests will be from all over the world and to ensure their wellbeing we should be flexible with their food preferences. Also I think it would greatly benefit the atmosphere of the event and the pleasure of our guests if they would not be bound to a seating arrangement.  Best wishes  Alex    
"Hi Alex! I think the main Music Act should be the Local Russian band, but if it's somehow possible maybe we can have some additional loosing up acts in between. ;-) Concerning the Catering I would prefer another local russian solution, but I'm willing to make a compromise on that (maybe an international three course meal that is served - I think this would be easier for the old people, and then not everybody is running around the hole time),  if you are fine with my suggestion about the Date of Conference. Best wishes Chris"
Hey Chris,  I would agree to your proposed date. And also to the other negotiation points except for the Catering.  I have really big concerns about guests not staying long or leaving hungry because they did not find something that they like to eat. I think today it is really hard to cater to such a variety of internatonal guests. Especially if you think of the limitations for health or religious reasons.  Also the international Buffet would of course feature Russian food as well. It would also be an option for me to talk to the caterer and see wether they could display the Russian Cuisine more prominently. And we also do have the local Russian band to honor the new subsidiary.  Best wishes.  Alex
Hi Alex! I think we are on a good way to find the right solution for all our issues but I'm really not with you regarding the International Buffet. I personally have sometimes been to a Buffet and there often is the problem that you only understand half of a conversation because you leave it in the middle or only hear it from the middle until the end because someone is standing up and is going to get some food. That is really not ideal for such an event. That's why I would prefer the Three course meal or the Russian cuisine.   For me, the only possibility to agree on the International Buffet would be if you change your opinion on the Sponsor Selection and we choose Boomerang as our main sponsor. It's your choice. Best wishes Chris
Hey Chris,  this would be an option for me.  But if you insist on this trade off, I have to insist on giving the speech myself. Because to me this was a concession I made for Art Inc. as the Sponsor.  Best Wishes  Alex  
Hi Alex! This would be ok for me! :-) I'm happy that we have found a conclusion that fits for both of us and I'm looking forward to an of course great event. I wish you all the best for all your future tasks. Best Regards Chris
"Good morning Chris, in order to prepare the event which is going to take part in Russia, the collaboration of both you and me is really important. You have huge knowledge about business contacts and their interests, because you have been part of ISA for a few years, but I think that my experience in planning and organising small events will be really helpful to make us winning these challenge. Apart from the issues we have already settled, I have been working on the rest of them by my own, but I want you to know that I have based on the concept of ""students"" as the most important one, so we have to create a big impact on them and to make sure we attract them, because we know they are the future talents. So here I show you my preferences on the issues for preparating the event: Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   As I told you, for me is really important the collaboration of both of us, and not to stay in a competitive position.  Read my proposes carefully and answer me as soon as you have your propose. Regards, Alex."
Dear Alex, I found your first offer very promising. I'm available to let you give the speech as I present the awards even though the importance of the matter. But I have to propose some changes as the importance of the catering and the sponsor can be huge for the success of the event. I think the act of DJ Happy could deviate the attentions of the event to him and so I propose either the FreeLife or the Local russian band. So here's my first counteroffer. Best regards, Chris
"Dear Chris, as I told you, we need to attrack the guests, that are going to come from different parts all over the world. So I have to make you understand the importance of an international act which can be familiar for the fame of the music. Thatï¿½s the reason why I think DJ Happy is the best one that fits in this that we are looking for. For the same reason I have to convince you to choose the international mixture when talking about the catering, because the local cuisine of Russia may not like everyone; and I have to tell you that maybe I can accept your proposal for the music, but I will stand strong in my position with the catering. The other issue in which we doesnï¿½t have an agreement is the sponsor. Boomerang has made a good offer, but not enough to cover the whole event. I can study carefully it proposal, but I assure you that the Art.Incï¿½s offer can cover the expenditures of the whole event. Try to look carefully again to my proposals and the reasons why I have choosed them. Kkind regards, Alex.  "
"Dear Alex, Even though we have to atract people from all around the world, the even is very important to promote our organization and I think DJ Happy could turn this event into ""DJ Happy"" performance, giving the organization less importance. That is the only thing I am worried about. The local Russian band would be a great option as we have to atract local people and show our interest for the local culture. A international buffet is also not the best option because i think a three course meal is mandatory to satisfy all the guests so they many options. Regarding the sponsor selection, Boomerang offers less money but they also offer a long-term contract. Art Inc. offers more but on a short-term contract and I think the organization could benefit more from the partnership with Boomerang. We both agree that Corporate Ltd. and Documenta are not good options though. Even though I think I have more experience and I think I would be the best option for the initial speech, I can give you this opportunity. But I expect you to think of my other proposals. We have to choose the best for the organization.  Try to understand the reason beyond my proposal and I think we are on the way to find a good agreement that is great for the organization and that satisfies both of us. Best regards, Chris"
Dear Chris, I have been looking carefully at your proposals and I think I can accept some of them. In relation to the sponsor, I can accpet Boomerang as a good one, because, as you said, the long-term contract would benefit us in the future too, so it is not a bad option. And about the music act, I prefer the FreeLife band, because it can satisty the guests, rather than a local band, because itï¿½s important to not forget that we are doing an international event. So as you told me in your first offer that FreeLife would be a good option for you, I can accept it. And about the catering, I keep saying that a three course meal is not good enough to make people meet and talk while they can  be walking around. Being sitting would only let them to talk to the people they have beside, so definetely this is not a good option to get involved in the international bussiness world with different kind of people. Think again on this if you can, and here is my final counteroffer: Catering: International buffet Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Regards, Alex.  
Dear Alex, I keep thinking we have to show some interest for the local culture. Either with local cuisine or music act. I don't mind having the FreeLife group if you really want it, but I think we should have local russian cuisine as catering to show our appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. It's on the best interest of our organization. Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, for me the most important things to prepare the event and make it successfully are both catering and the sponsor selection.  I have accepted the sponsor you told me , but  I canï¿½t accept also your proposal for catering. I keep thinking that the international buffet is the best option, and there will be also russian food, so it would also represent the Russian culture, and the other cultures too. And after accepting the FreeLife band that you told me, I need you to accept some of my proposals. So FreeLife band is okay and the sponsor can be, but not the three meal course. So you have to choose if you prefer the catering or the sponsor, but both is not possible, because that would be unfair for me because you have all your preferences but I donï¿½t have mine. Regards, Alex.
Dear Alex, I gave you the possibility to do the speech, even though it was important to me and I'm willing to let the catering as international buffet. That's 2 things. And the music act is also important to me also. I just accepted the FreeLife hoping you would be reasonable on the catering and not as a final offer. So I ask, is there possibility of having international buffet and Russian Local Band? I know it's not the best option for you, but it's also not for me. The important thing is to be the best option for our organization. Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, maybe we can do as you say, we can haver the International Buffet and the Local Band, but I think we need to choose the Art.Inc sponsor for that, because we will need more money for the russian band. I can give you the speech and I have the sponsor I need, if that is ok for you. Regards, Alex.
Dear Alex, According to what we discussed, here is my offer. I believe it meets the interest of the organization and also of both of us. Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I think your offer is a good one to compete on the organization of the event, in my opinion with these proposals we are going to be really strong competitors and we can have the opportunity of being successful on this. Kind regards, Alex.  
Dear Chris, I am very happy that we participate at the competition together. Sure, I am convinced that we can achieve a very integrative result when we work together at these very interesting topic and task. Fortunately, I have several experiences in dealing with such an event within these students organization. Thatï¿½s the reason why I have spoken with Andy, who is Dr. Illenschitzï¿½ assistant, a trusted person to our CEO. I got the information that it is generally possible that we get the promising job chances both if we achieve a convinced plan in team. This possible solution should we also taken into account.   So after all I think we have to go into more details. My really primary goals are the Sponsor Selection and Catering. Through my several experiences in preparing events with the organization I know the special wishes of the organization at these points. I am conviced that this are a main point for the valuation of the competition. So we have to take the Art Inc. as a really good sponsor.  The international catering is very important for the guests and the atmosphere.   Not so important for me is the presentation task. I think we operate as a team so we you can open the speech. Sure I think that I have very lots of experience in open a speech, so that is the best solution for me but maybe some other solutions are possible.   After all, we have to talk about the date of the conference. I think week 3 is the best. No alternative for me is Week 5 because these week is very closed to Christmas holidays.   I hope, that you will agree with me.   Kind regards, Alex  
Hello Alex, Thanks for your offer, I'm looking forward working with you on the conference planning. I strongly believe that as this conference is being held in Russia and we aim to please the local business people and officials, we should provide some locality in the conference. Thus I would like to have local Russian cuisine and a local band performing in the event. One of the things I believe we should have the local culture presented is the fact that ISA's success in foreign countries have been partly due to the adoption of local culture. It would also be a great way to show appreciation to their heritage and make the feel appreciated. I would also prefer Boomerang as the main sponsor due to a long-term deal we could get between ISA and Boomerang in terms of sponsorship. However I see the locality more important to me at this point and would be able to give the sponsorship deal to Art as I believe that it is of very high importance to you. In addition you can get your choice for the date of the conference. I consider sponsorship to be the single most important aspect in the conference as well, but I'm willing to let you get your preferred option there, provided that we can make a deal to have local music and cuisine at the event. Also it's good to hear that there might be two job chances available. Now we just have to make sure that we can come up with the possible plan for the conference. Please see my offer attached, hopefully I'll hear from you soon.   Best regards, Chris  
Hello Alex,   Thanks for your counter-offer. I believe that we do a good job and I am looking forward to planning an overwhelming event with you. I think we are not so far away from a presentable solution. I see that the location is a very important point to you. I want to go into more detail in the several aspects. First of all, you are right that the Sponsor Selection is a very important point for me. Furthermore the Catering is also a very important point for me because I think we have an international mixture where everybody should be able to find something they like to drink and eat.  Therefore we have to plan with an international catering for an easy-going atmosphere. We have to emphasize the multi-culture event through such an international catering. Thatï¿½s the reason for me to vote for an International buffet. Maybe you can go more in detail, what are you mean with locality, more precisely what is more important for you, the music act or the catering? Maybe we can search for a compromise at this point. I think if we get an international buffet at the event we can take the local Russian band to get a nice feeling with the Russian culture. I think that is a compromise between internationality and local Russian culture. A problem is if I follow this option I have to open the speech, because for me, the Band is a very boring act at all. Is this ok for you or not acceptable? I don't know how important is the presentation task to you? During the last events I saw that we have to engage a famous international act, like DJ Happy. Also the Pop band FreeLife is ok. That I have offered last time. But I see thatï¿½s a very important point to you so under these conditions I can give you this concession sure. All in all I will send you the counter-offer. I hope the changes are ok for you.   Hopefully I will hear from you soon, too. Best Regards, Alex
Hello Alex, Having a local russian cuisine is a bit more important for me than the musical event. I believe that the local cuisine would be greatly appreciated by the local business people and officials, and getting them to feel appreciated would certainly help as we don't want to repeat the failure we faced with the attempted establishment of the office in Moscow. Thus I suggest that we make a compromise, where the event would have a local cuisine, but you would get to give the prestigious opening speech for the event. This would mean that you get your choices for sponsor, date and presentation, while I would choose the catering and music act. On the other hand, I think I could also settle with Freelife for music act, should Boomerang be the main sponsor of the event. Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris, Thank you for your answer. The catering is for me also a main point, so I see that is a complicated and important issue but we find an acceptable solution for both. Maybe I can make a concession by sponsoring and we take the Boomerang, thatï¿½s what you mentioned. If we choose this, then we have to take the International buffet and the DJ Happy for the international atmosphere.  I can also make a concession to you and we take the FreeLife, thatï¿½s what you mentioned.  Then we have to take the international buffet in any case. Is that a better solution to you? Maybe we can also talk about the date.  For me it is not so important if we take week 3 or 4. There is also a scope for negotiation for us. Best regards, Alex
Hello Alex, your offer is quite upsetting as it is actually worse than your previous offer. As I see the issue here, we both value catering and sponsor selection quite highly, so I think it should be fair that one should get his choice of catering, while the other has his choice of sponsor. For me getting local Russian cuisine is more important than having Boomerang as a sponsor. I'm also willing to let you have your choice of FreeLife performing during the conference, but this is quite a reach from my perspective. But I still think that we should aim for the best possible option for both, and having a local cuisine and an international band would be a nice mix of international and local atmosphere. Best regard, Chris
Hello Chris, thanks for your counteroffer. For me was the upsetting offer not better at all. So I see that was not a very good offer. I think you are right with your assumptions and I agree with your argumentation. But when we take the local Russian cuisine then I have to open the speech. All in all I also think we have a very nice mixture with this band and the local Russian cuisine. I think after all we can take this deal and I hope that you agree with me. Furthermore I think we have to arrange very quickliy. I hope that I hear from you soon. Best Regards, Alex
Hello Alex, thanks for the offer, I see that we have made some progress on a compromise,while I still think I can't agree to that deal. As I'm a bit unsure about your preferences regarding the difference between music, presentation and sponsor selection, I ask if you prefer to get your choice in both music and presentation, while I would get the sponsor (Boomerang). While I prefer Freelife over DJ Happy I would be willing to settle with DJ Happy and the opening speech to you. Please enlighten me how you prefer these and we'll be able to better work on a compromise. Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris, sorry for the misanderstanding. The Sponsor Selection is the most important Issue for me but also a very important point is the Catering. The Local Russian cuisine is very bad for me, so I have to get some goals at the music act, the presentation tasks and the date of Converence. The Music Act, the presentation tasks and the date of the conference are approximately equal important. But at all, if we don't take the Pop band FreeLife, then i lose very much. Maybe Week 4 is better than week 3 for you? That can be an last compromise to me. Best Regards, Alex
Hello Alex, thanks for the clarification, I tried to make a new offer with some restructuring that I believe would be better for you than my previous offer. While I would get the sponsor and music act, I would be ready to leave the three remaining parts to you. Hopefully this or the other offer is to your liking. Best regards, Chris
Hello Cris, Thank you for your counteroffer. Unfortunately your offer is quite upsetting because it is actually worse than your previous offer from 10.December. I see the issue is, that we both value catering and sponsor selection quite highly. I think we should take your offer from the 10 December. Thatï¿½s the reason why I send you this offer again. I agree that the offer should be fair. One should get his choice of catering, while the other has his choice of sponsor. For you getting local Russian cuisine is more important than having Boomerang as a sponsor. For me the sponsor is very important. At the other points we have a nice compromise. You can open the speech, thats my concession. Having the local cuisine and the international band would be a nice mix of international and local atmosphere. All in all I take the compromise that you can open the event. Last but not least I think that we should take this offer from 10. December. Best regard, Alex
Hello Alex, thanks for the offer. I think this is a good compromise to both of us and I have accepted the offer. I believe we have a good shot at winning the competition, hopefully we work together again with the arrangements of the conference. Best regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, how are you? I am happy to have you as my partner for this year's competition and I am very confident that we will work out a good team concept for the conference. Please find attached my opening offer and let me know what you think. Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, it's great to hear from you! I am also looking forward to working with you. I like how you immediately get to the action. From my point of view it would be great to show the Russian guests that we truly care about them and their culture. This is why I think it might be a good idea to use local cuisine and music. What do you think? Best, Chris
Dear Chris,  thank you for you fast reply. I am glad that we both agree on Art Inc. as our sponsor and on Week 3 as the perfect week for the event.  However, I do not completely share your opinion about the cultural program. As our guest are very multi-cultural, I think it would be smarter to give them an international choice of food. So that those who want to, can try some typical russian food and the others still have a big choice of other international specialities. I'm affraid that guest will stay hungry if they don't like the russian cuisine.  Concerning the music, I am also a little concerned that russian music might influence the athmosphere in a bad way. Having an international famous performer, such as Dj Happy, would in my opinion ensure a great athmosphere for all guests from various countries. Talking from my point of view, people keep events better in mind if the athmosphere was authentic.  Best,  Alex   
Dear Alex, I'm afraid that we have not finally agreed on anything yet: Neither the sponsor nor the week. At least not from my point of view, as I left these two points untouched since I did not want to reject your whole offer in my first email to you. I thought it might work out if you picked two and i picked two. However, it looks like we two have very divergent preferences. Maybe we should take a step back. What is most important to you? From my point of view that would be: Sponsor Selection Music Act Catering Presentation Tasks Date of conference I propose that we define an order that we tackle one point after the other. Best, Chris
Dear Chris,  defining an order sounds like a good way to go on from now.  My preferences are as followed: Sponsor Selection  Catering  Date of Conference  Music Act  Presentation Task  I would be willing to make concessions regarding the catering. However, I think that Art Inc. is still the best sponsor. As the have supported the ISA for a very long time and are very realiable, we should not risk this great relations! Also I do not agree with the local russian band, maybe we can find a compromise regarding the music.  What do you think about my new offer?  Best,  Alex 
Dear Alex, thank you for the response! It definitely looks like we both are going to have to make a few concessions along the way. It's gonna be a game of Tit for Tat, I guess :) So, from my point of view Boomerang would be a better main sponsor and Week 3 also is not my favorite choice. Nonetheless, I'm willing to accept these lesser options as they both rank quite high for you. In the case of the sponsor selection, it is the most important issue for both us. This is why I would kindly ask you to consider concessions in my favour on the remaining items in negotiation. I believe that this would be a balanced approach and fair to both. Unfortunenately, it looks like we cant get both everything that we want. Best, Chris
Dear Chris,  I like the way you think. Tit for tat seems fine. And I am glad that we found our first agreement.  However, I still don't agree that we choose both, Catering and Music, to be Russian. I think that all in all the event will loose its' international character then. Where would you rather want to make concessions? Catering or Music?  Maybe we can find a compromise regarding the Week. If Week 3 is not your favorite week, what else would it then be? I would be very happy to make concessions in this regard.  Best,  Alex 
Dear Alex, thank you for your response! To be honest, I thought of it to be a good deal as we both got the top option for 2 out of 3 top priorities. I already offered to give in regarding my top priority, i.e. the main sponsor. The date of the conference is not as important to me as to you, so I thought it would also makes sense to lean in your direction here. On the other, I would need some points on my score sheet and the next two priority items after the sponsor are, unfortunately, catering and music. To me both of them should definitely be truly Russian, anything else is something that I cannot fully support and would go directly against my interests.  What if I also try to accommodate you as best as I can in the last item to negotiate, the presentation task? This would mean you got the top pick in 3 out of 5, including your top priority. Doesn't that sound quite ok to you? Best, Chris
Dear Chris,  to be honest, I am having a hard time believing you about your preference for the week. However, our deals has to be settled soon and I do not like to risk our deal in the end. So, let's make the deal.  Best,  Alex 
Dear Chris, I would firstly like to welcome you to this negotiating process. This is the opening message to our negotiation regarding the organization of the conference in Russia. My name is Chris and I joined to ISA in 2005 in the context of a student internship at one of the business partners of ISA. Since then, I cooperate with business contacts of the ISA in order to organize internships and other projects and hence I have great experience in these matters. As part of this proceeding I want to discuss the various aspects step by step with you and not all the points at once. Here is my first offer: First, let me set the date of the conference with you. I prefer the third week on December for the reason that important personalities cannot take part in our conference in the first two weeks. The fourth and fifth week would also not be the best alternative for us, because these are the days that are very timely manner at Christmas. For this reason, I propose that we set the third week.  Date of Conference: Week 3   What is your opinion regarding this aspect? Best regards   Alex
Dear Alex, thanks for your welcome words, hope we are going to make a good negotiation. But firstly, I have a question. Are you sure that you are Alex? Sometimes you write your name as Alex, sometimes as Chris.  When I've got an email, it was written that you are Alex and me Chris, but you sent me this: My name is Chris and I joined to ISA in 2005 in the context of a student internship at one of the business partners of ISA. Since then, I cooperate with business contacts of the ISA in order to organize internships and other projects and hence I have great experience in these matters. Can you just shortly write what has happened? I just want to know your name, so Chris or Alex?   I'm so sorry for such a strange question, but it's really important.     Kind regards,  Chris  
Dear Chris,  it was my mistake. Of course I am Alex. I mixed up both parties. Sorry for this confusion. So again: My name is Alex, I am your partner for this negotiation task. I joined the ISA as a student member in 2009 when starting my studies. I have a lot of experience in planning and organising smaller events which were always very successful. I look forward to a successful negotiation process with you.  Best regards Alex
Dear Alex, it's good that we've figurated out what was wrong. Now we can start with our negotiation.   As far as you know, we have to prepare a conference day and for us it is really important to prepare it good. We can really open our way to the bussiness world with a good negotiation.  And it's good to know that it's a Conference with russian company, so I think it is important to have a typical russian day/evening... I agree with you to go step by step, but I have to inform you that everything is important for me, not just Date of Conference. So, for me, the 3rd week is good, I can confirm it. Here is my offer: The next step is probably how will the evening look like. I think it has to be a typical russian evening. So I suggest  Catering: local Russian cuisine   Music Act: Local Russian band  .   Kind regards, Andrej       Kind regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, First of all I want to thank you for your counteroffer. I can understand you in your situation and that you have more than one important point to discuss. That is exactly the same case for me. However, in order to enable a structured work I wanted to discuss the points step by step. I am an open and honest person and also the last person in the world who make problems during a conflict solving process. This aspect can be confirmed by my previous colleagues who organized successful projects with me for the ISA in the past. I would also like to say openly in advance at this point that I aim to find a solution for the conflict points that are reasonable for both negotiation parties. A satisfaction on both sides leads to a better working atmosphere, to a better cooperative attitude and therefore to the best result for our conference. But due to this purpose of course concessions must be made on both sides. For this reason, I will negotiate openly and honestly with you and ask you to do the same as well. With respect to your counteroffer, I am pleased to say that we have achieved our first agreement in the point of Date of Conference in week 3. Date of Conference: Week 3   Furthermore, I would like to support our good cooperation and want to make another concession regarding the music band. Despite the fact that the local Russian band is the worst option I can choose I want to fulfill your wish an accept this.  Music Act: Local Russian band   Since this conference is an international conference and the guests that are invited are from all over the world it is not a good idea to offer simply the local Russian cuisine.  Of course, the place of choice should also be given for the Russian cuisine, but not as the only option. I think that our guests should feel right at home and comfortable and should be able to choose the food they desire. So this is the reason why I ask Catering: International buffet   at this point. I am sure that you will agree with me on this point. I would also like to disclose an additional point at this point which has agreat significance for me as well. This is the aspect to consider Art Inc as our sponsor for this event because they made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  To be honest the task of catering and the selection of our sponsor are the both points that are the most important for me.  What is your opinion concerning my offer? Through open and honest communication, we will resolve all the obstacles. Please tell me about your thoughts.  I wish you a good night and good luck with your activities Best regards   Alex
Dear Alex, it is always good to see when the person on the other side feels welcome and is prepared to negotiate. At that point I really agree. Let's make our negotiation and discussions in the way that at the end we can say that it was fair, and that both of us were totally honest and that in the future we can make another negotiation. I have your words and you have mine, so let's be open and honest. Yes, first step is behind us. I am sure a lot of Russian people will come on that date. Date of Conference: Week 3 . Our celebration will be ombined with the celebration of the newly established subsidary in Saint Petersburg. It is a huge opportunity to use the event to get in touch with Russian companies and to win them over for the partner network. The celebration will attract actually a big amount of important russian public figures and russian business people. So all in all I think there will be more than a half of Russian people at the celebration and they are known that they really like their own food. I think it should be like typical Russian dinner/evening with their food and music Music Act: Local Russian band  . And I also think it would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. So, I really want to make a big impression on them. That's why I can't afford to have international buffet. So I still suggest  Catering: local Russian cuisine I have to be honest with you too and tell you that a food choice/catering and presentation task are my preferences. The opening ceremony is the perfect place to reach a broad and especially Russian audience. It is another chance to make a good impression. Can you help me with that? I would kindly ask you to have a special announcing of the winner of the yearly ISA award? Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   It gives us the opportunity to make an impression and a good start with new Russian members and company leaders. Actually a sponsor task is not one of mine important tasks, so for me is ok to have Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. .   Ok, what do you think about my offers? Hope that you will mostly agree with them.    Kind regards, Chris    
"Dear Chris, first of all I want to thank you for your answer and your counteroffer. I am sure that we will get along very well in our lasting negotiation process of this negotiation and also in future negotiations. Your last reply showed me that you understood my message regarding the point of trust and honesty between us. You proved this aspect by saying openly like me what your important points are and which negotiation options are possible in our case. I appreciate this behavior from you. I have analyzed your counteroffer and have to say that I can understand your point, although this is not entirely consistent with my idea. But I am sure that we will find a solution for this. As I said at the beginning of the task a negotiation process can only be a success for both parties if concessions are made. This is the reason why I accept your offer with let doing you the opening speech and me only the second part of the speech that is not so important as the first one. The fact that you do the opening speech is the worst option I am able to choose. But well, we are a team and are conducting a successful negotiation. I definitely believe that this concession will support our collaboration. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  . We hereby achieved a further agreement in the presentation task. Congratulations for this! Concerning the case of how to organize the catering of the conference you can possibly remind from my previous messages that I disclosed my prioritization of this task and said that this is an important point for me as well. This was the reason why I've offered initially my maximum choice of ""International buffet"". Now you come up with my worst option and hence with your maximum. I think that we should try to find a solution regarding this point. And I am happy to say that I found one to solve this conflict situation of the catering! :)   I am ready to approach a step on you. Therefore I am ready to go without my maximum offer of ï¿½International buffetï¿½ and make a concession by proposing my worst case for the catering point to Catering: local Russian cuisine    .This is a big concession from my side to you. Thus, I have waived my most important point for you and now you have done your two most important points, am I right? But I beg you now to make a concession for me as well so that we can reach a fair position for both of us. I ask you to adapt the music art to Music Act: DJ Happy if I give you your best case in the task of organizing the catering. Thus, this would be a concession on your part  to equalize our utility functions. I suggest consciously this adjustment-solution, because it is the only possibility to give you your maximum points without beeing ""expolited"" from you. Thus, this is a win-win sitution for both of us. I give you your key points and in return I would like to have a point that is less important. We are almost there where we both want to be and we have only until tomorrow :)  I would be very delighted if you would accept my proposal and my approach to find a good solution for both of us as I made here. My sincere intention is to achieve a good negotiation for both of us through an open communication attitude.  I wish you a good week and hope to have a long-term cooperation with you. Best regards   Alex"
Dear Alex, that is what I alwasys do, trying to understand people on the other side . That is the way I like to do and more important I want to do. I really appreciate people who are honest and open with me. But, on the other side, I do not like people who are selfish and are trying to lie to me. But let's go step by step or sentence by sentence. I really understand you and how to negotiate and I know that we have to make important concessions. Well, it is very good that you understand the meaning of the opening speech. I know that the opening speech is very prestigious and I could have the possibility to adress many important aspects of the future development of ISA, furthermore I think announcing the winner of the yearly ISA award and giving a certificate to the respective person is actually important too, but not that attractive. So I will leave that option open and you will see why. I am so glad that you understood my point of view I totally agree about how to organize the catering of our conference. Yes that is a truth and you are right. My preference tasks were Catering and Presentation. I am really honored that you understand my interests So, you were right, thanks. Now let's talk about our Music Act choices. You have said during your previous messages that the  Music Act: Local Russian band is the worst option you can choose but you wanted to fulfill my wish and accepted. So, actually that meaned that you do not really care about music's choice. And what do you want to ask me now? To accept DJ Happy? Are you trying to confuse me or just trying to lie to me. Once you accept it, once you change it. It is not the way how to negotiate. I am very sad and angry. You have exploited me. It is not the way. You asked me if I can accept the 3rd week of our Conference. I kindly said yes. You asked me about Sponsor Selection and I kindly and so honestly answered you that it is not my most important task, so you should feel free when choosing it.  And you are trying to change something it was accepted by you. You have told me that your points of interest are Catering and Sponsor Selection, but never the Music's choice. I really do not believe you anymore like before. I need not to be nice and honest, but I will give you 1 more chance. There it is. Now you can see why I left the Presentation task open. I give you a chance that you can choose the Opening speech which is I think is really really important and you know it Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris .  Actually I am a little bit sad and angry, because usually when I negotiate with my partners they are honest and reliable. But I want judge you anymore.   Hope you are going to think about it and I believe that you can accept this offer. Best regards, Chris    
"Dear Chris,  I beg you to calm down yourself. I can not understand why you react like this? To act in such an aggressive style shows that you haven't understood my request to act honestly and to make concessions.  I have not changed my position and the disclosed informations I had mentioned. I told you that catering is one of my main points and that I will not be able to accept this without getting a concession on the other side. I refuse to be exploited by you. This was the reason why I have offered an option to find a solution for this conflict situation that the organization of the catering is one of the two main points of both of us. Do you link an effort of trying to make a solution that you can get your both best facts with lieing? This is more than ridiculous. You should know that a progressive negotiation develops new situations and a new basis for negotiation (including all negotiation aspects!!!). Otherwise, no solutions can be developed! You told me that the presentation and the catering are your main points. This was the reason why I tried everything that you can get your both main points. From this it can be deduced that the music act was not one of your important points.  Now you come and renounce your ""best point"" of presentation what should be an important point for you as you said? Are you aggressive because of the fact that you did not tell the truth about the music act task (and this task is one of your real important points) or because I've changed a point that has no importance for you in order to find a solution for you? I renounce one of my most important point, and you insist on both. And you want me to tell something about open and honest negotiation?  This is a conflict and a contradiction in your statement and in your honesty. Of course, the other negotiating points like the music act need to be adjusted if solutions have to be generated.  But I'm not going to accuse you as a liar. This contradicts to my behavior and my conduct. I've always been someone who has respected the opinion of the other person and this fact will remain so.  You broke my trust and I would never negotiate with you again. Nevertheless, I will not affect my sadness about your falsehood in emotional way. Someone else would have rejected this negotiation at this point.  I accept your offer.  Best regards,  Alex"
Hi Chris, i have been thinking about the organization of the conference in the last few days and I think I had a couple of interesting ideas. In my opinion we should really look for to organize a show with the goal of both astonishing the students and  advertising the companies.  So, i suggest:   Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 4 Music Act: DJ Happy    Presentation Tasks: Third person   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   I am particularly worried about the catering since we need to reserve it some weeks in advance. Tell me sincerely what do you think so we can plan everything in time.  Best regards Catering: International buffet  , Alex
Hi Alex, i think it would be really great for our students and also our local partners to not only come to russia to have the same old boring international meeting, but also to learn something about the local culture (food, music, etc.) I think not only would we all profit from getting new knowledge, it would also increase the chance to get longterm sponsoring from local companies there. As this is the 40th anniversary of ISA we should offer a bit more than just a buffet. Also i highly doubt that it would be a good idea to have this event too close to Christmas,  i don't know how that's for you, but in my life the last week before christmas is usually always stressful. Also i don't know how good you are in holding speeches, i have been working very hard and would be looking very happily forward to hold the opening speech. Would it be ok for you if i could hold this speech and you would present the awards? I do know our sponsors and business contacts quite a bit and wouldn't want anything during the opening ceremony be ruined or forgotten because i gave this important task to someone else, who didn't care so much about it. A third person doing this would be my least preferred variant. So here's my offer: Catering: local Russian cuisine  Music Act: Local Russian band Sponsor Selection: Boomerang Date of Conference: Week 3   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sincerly Chris
Hi Chris, I totally agree with the week proposed. Moreover I think with should esploit your experience in speech, so I agree also with that proposal.  Onestly I understand your point about learning somenthing about the local culture, but on the other side we must be sure of satisfy people coming from all over the world. What if many of them do not appreciate the local cuisine o do not even know the local band? I would suggest somenthing with more international appeal. one more thing, what do you think about the sponsor? should we give up the more money offered by our old partner ISA?  we are risking our long term relationship with them. I mean I am open t both the company but I would like to know your idea. so my offer is: Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   sincerely Alex
Hi, I'm glad we agreed on the week Date of Conference: Week 3  and on the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  , also i believe that our sponsoring selection Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  is the right one. Concerning the food russian is by area the largest country in the world and therefore has a very diverse cuisine. I'd like to cite from wikipedia: Russia's great expansions of culture, influence, and interest during the 16thï¿½18th centuries brought more refined foods and culinary techniques, as well as one of the most refined food countries in the world. It was during this period that smoked meats and fish, pastry cooking, salads and green vegetables, chocolate, ice cream, wines, and juice were imported from abroad. At least for the urban aristocracy and provincial gentry, this opened the doors for the creative integration of these new foodstuffs with traditional Russian dishes. The result is extremely varied in technique, seasoning, and combination. Or to show you this in pictures: http://www.buzzfeed.com/tashweenali/delicious-russian-foods-for-your-sochi-olympics-party#.tnxE2p14Y Imagine you're going into an old russian castle, people in russian clothes serving you caviar and smoked salmon, in the background there's some russian music playing. You take a seat and start talking to your seat neigbours about how you only knew beef stoganov so far and are excited by the variety of different tastes. This event we're planning should leave a great impression on our guests and therefore i guess should be exquisit, proud on the local culture, which we as a multinational orginazation also want to represent. It's about making contacts and therefore it shouldn't be about only rushing to eat your food fast and dance to the same old band you've heard a thousand times. It should be about making contacts, talking to people you've never talked before, even if it's about you and your seat neighbour daring to eat this food you've never seen before. When we make this event based with this idea in mind i bet it can only get great. What do you say, would you reconsider my offer to have Catering: local Russian cuisine  and Music Act: Local Russian band  ? Sincerly Chris
  Hi,  I'm glad we agreed on the week Date of Conference: Week 3on the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  and on the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang. It was quite interesting reading about the russian cuisin and also the imagine you suggsted is interesting. Unfortunately they would be great if we were an organization of retired people, not for our custumers that are students. With both local cuisine and local music with risk to dissatisfy many students, especially those from abroad. Then the presence of an international band would be an important avertising for our conference. Moreover we cannot offer somenthing that me and you are curious about, we should respect everybody and having a uffet will allow everyone to find at least somenthing they like. So stay in my offer: Catering: International buffet  and Music Act: FreeLife  Nico
"Hi Alex, seems like someone named Nico used your account - probably just your autocorrect malfunctionned ;) It seems we're a bit stuck in our conversation, time to find a compromise. You're right we're an organization for young people, but we also have to serve the needs for our longterm members (it's our 40th birthday and also a lot of older members will be coming, also our sponsors aren't always that young) I really wouldn't want to see our longest supporters and sponsors standing in line in front of a buffet, so if you really insist on having international food, can we at least have an Catering: International three course meal  ? If you agree on that i guess i could get used to the idea of having Music Act: FreeLife  as a music act. In that way we could serve the needs of our old members as well as our younger students. Sincerly Chris"
Hi Chris, yes actually someone hackerated my account, I think the KGB is controlling our negotiation! my offer would have been a bit different but I see we have done many progresses in this negotiation. I really like your offer and i would like to meeting one of your previous request: what if we decide for Music Act: Local Russian band  but we keep a Catering: International buffet ? This looks at me as a win win solution, regards, the REAL Alex
Hi, I think we just found a solution that both of us like, i think we can organize some extra staff for our senior members who need help and still bring some russian culture to our guests. It was nice negotiating with you Alex - looking forward to this event :) Sincerly Chris
Hey Chris, how are you doing? I think that we haven't met before, have we? My name is Alex and I have already organized events, which were all very successfull! I'm very happy, that we have the possibility to acquire some new students in our International Student Association by organizing this international conference. I'm also very excited about getting to know the vice president, because I haven't met him yet. Because of the importance of this event, I have thinked a lot about how to celebrate the event and think that you can agree with that plan. First, I would like to talk with you about the Sponsor Selection: As you know, the Art inc. company, which supports us since a long time, made the best offer. We need this money with a high priority because the event will be very costly! There is no need to consider any other companies. The sponsor has also the ability to give a presentation on the main stage during the event. I think, that we can do that after the opening ceremony, because then everyone is focused on the stage anyway. You are responsible to make contracts with businesses and to put students in contact with businesses in terms of internship, aren't you? Then it would be a great possibility to you, if you would speak on the stage a short time before the presentation of the sponsor will be held. You could then turn the presentation over from awarding the ISA members, which had a big impact for the ISA, to a member of the Art Inc. This member will remember you afterwards and so you can consolidate the relationship to the Art Inc. afterwards. I will then hold the opening speech for you. I hope that you can agree with that. Kind regards Alex
Hey Alex,   I'm doing well thank's for the question.   At first I'd like to say I'm glad to have you as a partner and that ISA have been given us this opportunity to organize this event. The outcome of this event could have a high impact of our future careers at ISA, so for me it's important that we work as a team, although we may have different preferences.    You said you want to do the main speech. You know the main speech is much more prestigious than the awards ceremony, so I'd suggest we do it together as it would also emphasize our great teamwork. Alternatively, if the main speech is really important for you, I'd be ok with that and I'll step in the background for you, if we could agree that the catering and the music act is local. That would also show ISA's interest in the Russian culture and this will attract many potential business partners in Russia for ISA.   Because the financing of the event is for sure the most important part, and I'm not satisfied with Art Inc. for different reasons, I suggest with postpone the discussion of thter sponsor selection to the end.   Kind regards,   Chris
Hey Chris, thank you for your response. I am also pleased to work with you! I would appreciate, if I could do the opening speech, but we have to talk about the catering as well as music act, again.   First you are right that it is important to attract many business partners to the ISA. However, I'm sure that the kind of music will have no impact on the attraction to business partners. Or do you really think that real business men and women only go to an event because of the music act?? The business partners want to do business and are not there to have a nice evening. If so, these business partners are not really trustworthy and I don't want to work with them anyway. So we should lay the focus on filling the conference. As I could recognize, the guests were getting increasingly dissatisfied of the music at ISA events. But I'm here with a solution: To attract also many young people, I would go for DJ Happy, which is a very famous performer. He regularly fills huge venues and so alone his presence would attract many people. Upon reverse, many of these will be interested in the ISA, and join the ISA. So companies will automatically work with the ISA to get access to these talents. As a result we have a win to win situation.     At a second point you are also right that local food could be tasty for the russian people. But I am worried about that many of the guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine. So I would recommend a buffet, so that everyone can eat what they want. (From my side of course russian food can be included in the meal, but not only!)   Best regards Alex
Hey Alex, At first, thanks to the fast respond. I'd like to reemphasize that we should *really* work as a team and we should both benefit from the negotiation outcome. I told you that I would accept to stand in the background to let you do the main speak, which could be really advantageous for you (all participants would perceive you as the main organizer), and in return i'd like to choose the catering and the music act. Your offer is basically to choose all three things to what is most benefictial for you. I'd could tell you many arguments why we should choose to do russian catering/music but thats not the point here, I'm sure you can understand the fact, that this is not a one-way street. Do you understand what I mean? I'm sending you my offer again. I'm looking forward to your response, but please understand if you are not willing to collaborate that I'll also reconsider the fact that I'll you will do the main speech. But again I think we both get the most utility out of this if we work together, thats the best for us and also for ISA, partner :-) 
Hey Alex, I explained you factually the reasons, why I would prefer the catering as a buffet (people from other countries are not familiar with the russian meat, a buffet would include russian meat as well as other food, where everyone can eat what he wants) and why whe should choose DJ Happy as the music act (regularly fills huge venues, young people are coming to the conference, join the ISA and businesses will be attracted). For me, the main point is that we will organize this event so that the ISA will benefit most. The competition grows stronger and we will have to make strategic decisions about how to strenghten the ISA (e.g. by winning young people for the ISA). You said, that it is not the point that we should discuss about pros and contras, but it is. We can really only then work together, if you tell me your reasons about your proposals. After that we can discuss together in a team to find the best solution. Best regards Alex
"Hey! The reason why I would prefer a real menu and not some kind of buffet is, because we there will be  many important people who expect a certain level of formality. I think anything less than a three course meal would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years, which werenï¿½t even some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversary (!!) and thus would harm the prestige of the ISA. And DJ Happy is indeed a very famous international music star, and I know that this DJ would probably be more attractive, *especially* for the younger generation, but I think the strategy of the event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with (local) companies and officials. There is no guarantee that his reputation would not overshadow the reputation of the ISA, distracting attention from the event towards the music act. I have heard about festivals with DJ Happy as the performer and I canï¿½t imagine to have ISA as a ""side-act"" to DJ Happy. So these are my arguments, but I don't think over-arguing about the different pro and contra will lead to something (at least not in a short time) because we can clearly see that we  have different opionions.  And I think you will agree with me, that we should not waste too much time negotiating but come to a fast agreement and then begin with the actual organization, which is for sure also most benefical for ISA. Again - I'm ready to do some compromises - but you also have to. So what do you think?   Kind regards, Aley"
Hey Chris, thank you for your explanations. Now I can better comprehent your positions and that will take us a step forward. Even if I think, that DJ Happy would have fit very well I can understand your concerns about that DJ Happy could overshadow the reputation of the ISA. I have another idea: The pop band FreeLife could perform as the music act. Its popularity is not exatly comparable to DJ Happy, but it could be enough to keep the guests satisfied. So there is no problem about overshadowing the conference, anymore. So I can make you an offer: I will dispense with DJ Happy and additionally I will give you the opening speech. In return I would like to choose the buffet, which would also have the advantage, that everyone is able to moove free around and talk to several guests. This would lead to a much more relaxed atmosphere. I am looking forward to hear from you. Best regards Alex
Hi,   At first I want to say thank you for realising that collaborating is the best way to go, and for making a realistic offer.   For said reasons, a buffet is a no-go for me, I think we cannot risk to harm the prestige of the ISA. At past events we had at least a three course meal and this is the anniversary so in my opinion it would be ridiculous to have a buffet. You said your main concern is that international guests are not familiar with the russian food. If we choose an upper-class catering service I'm sure they'll serve some international meals as well so everybody is happy.   In previous mails you told me you want to do the opening speech, and I was ok with that. So now I'm a little bit confused, because you changed your mind.  For the purpose of a meaningful negotiation it's really important that I know your values in order to find a solution which fits both for us, so could you please elaborate why you changed your mind so fast?   Although I said when you do the main speech, I want to choose both the buffet and the music act, it's ok for me to do a compromise on the music act for the purpose of a quicker negotiation outcome.   Did you already think about the date of the conference? What would be the best option for you?     Kind regards, Chris  
"Hi Chris, even it is the 40th anniversary of our association, our main focus should lay on the purpose of winning new members for the ISA. Therefore, we need a very relaxed atmosphere to faciliate the possibilities to network. We can only do that, if we have a buffet. Think also on big conferences. On all of these you can find a buffet. At least, we are a *student* organization and so there is no need to be too formal. How else would you justify that we are called, ""international *student* association""? The offer that you could conduct the presentation is only applicable for me, if we will choose the buffet as catering. The catering is a more important aspect for me than my own prestige. Because of all of these reasons, I would like you to reconsider my offer. What would you think about week three? According to my information, in this week there are no complications with other events.   Best regards Alex"
Ok, fine. I will accept week 3 although I'd prefer other dates. I will accept no russian catering (although this is the most important thing for me and therefore we have to make at least a compromise and do a three course meal) If we select Boomerang  as the sponsor (lets not talk about arguments here, I'm sure you have good arguments against and I have arguments in return) So let us come to an end.
Hey Chris, thank you for your response! It really seems to me, that the catering is a very important point for you. The sponsor selection is also very important for me. If I interpret you rightly, you prefere Boomerang and I prefere Art Inc. because of that I wan't to describe my following arguments, so that you can understand my choice:   If we choose Boomerang, which is a direct competitor to Art Inc., we would loose Art Inc. propably forever. I am convinced that Art Inc will also support us in the future, if they have no reason to change their mind. If we would not choose them as our partner again, this would be such a reason and as I said, we would loose them as our partner. Moreover they had also made the best offer. Because of these reasons, we should choose Art Inc. Even if I think, that you also have arguments to choose Boomerang, I have another idea so that we can come to a fair compromis: I will give you the choice to choose the catering (the local Russian cuisine) and you will give me the choice to choose the sponsor (Art Inc.) in return. Would that be okay for you? I hope, that we can come together to a solution and I'm waiting exitedly for your response.   Have a nice evening!   Best regards Alex
Why did you change both the presentation task and the sponsor selection? Thats not acceptable for me, choose one or another. 
We negotiated about that point before and I said, that I only agree that you have the speech, if I could choose the buffet. It seems, that we both want to present the speech and so to gain as much attention as possible. However, we should think about what's the best for the event: An external speaker, who talks about the importance of the ISA would be defnitely worth it! This speech would improve the quality of the conference very much. Even if that's not my first choice, it would be a fair compromise. Do you agree on that?
what about doing it together, since *we* are organizing this event?
No, this alternative would mean a too high coordination expense.
Ok lets recap:   We chose your favorite Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  , which was important for you, we chose my type of catering: Catering: local Russian cuisine   which was important for me. Then we made a compromise about the Music Act: FreeLife . Now since we are also choosing Date of Conference: Week 3  it would be fair to let me choose the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex . If you say yes we can finish the negotiation.  I think we both gain utility from this negotiation outcome. This seems fair to me, what do you think?
Okay, because we have to come to an end, I agree with that. I hope, that the event will be successfull.   Best regards Alex
Hey Chris Iï¿½m really looking forward to work with you on the this years Annual Conference 2016/ 40th anniversary celebration of ISA in Russia. I believe that the both of us will develop a very good concept, which will convince the board and makes us the winners of internal challenge! Attached you can find my indicative plans regarding the event. I want you to now, that all points are negotiateable. You can regard it as my ideas about an ideal event from my point of view.   The basic idea behind my proposal is, that we keep in mind the international/global vision of ISA and also present this to the audience. Furthermore I propose to set a focus on the needs and interest of our present and future members. Thereby I hope, that we can acquire a lot of new members and furthermore transmit an open and dynamic image of a young and motivated association. In my opinion this will also be the basis to convince new compnies of the variety of talents of the ISA, which will finally lead to new business partners. What do you think of this basic approach?   For me personally our overall aim should be a good event. Therefore Iï¿½m excited about your ideas, so that we can develop commonly a good concept for the event. I think this will also be the most important point of our individual evaluation with regards to the internal challenge. At least this is what I have heard from a friend of mine working closely together with the board. Have you further information about our common evaluation? Iï¿½m really looking forward to hear your ideas so that we can discuss our plans. Best regards Alex    
Hey Alex, thank you for your proposal and your effort! Due the fact that this years Annual Conference will take place in russia and many locals will be participating, I would really appreciate when you are comfortable with a local Russian cuisine and a local Russian band. In my mind the Russian cuisine/band will help us to extend our network and strenghten the relationships between ISA and local Russian companies and important public figures. Furthermore a buffet for a 40th anniversary is not very appropriate, or what do you think!? In my opinion this would disturb the communication at the tables, because everyone is in hurry to be first at the buffet...  However I am very comfortable with your choice regarding the conference date in week 3! Of course the event should be great and I think you will do a good job! As you already specified you would like to do the opening speech, that's ok on condition that Boomerang is selected as sponsor. I know Boomerang offers slightly less money, on the other hand they are offering a long-term contract which ensures further events. Art Inc. offers more money I know, but have you thought about the fact what happens next year? If Art. Inc. is not extending the sponsoring contract, we will have to look for additional sponsors again... I hope you are comfortable with my thoughts and ideas and I'm looking forward to hear from you soon! Best regards, Chris
  Hey Chris,   Thank you very much for your proposal.   Sorry for my delayed answer, Iï¿½ve been quite busy in the last few days. However for next two days will constantly available for you. Consequently I think we will find an agreement quite fast, now.   I really appreciate to see, that weï¿½ve already found an agreement on week 3. And thank you for the trust in me with regards to the opening speech. With regards to the other issues we will also find a solution.     I think the basic difference I our approaches are, that you wanted to implement the Russian background into the conference. I think this also a good approach. For being honest, I also thought about to do so on first hand. However then I thought about fundamental understanding of the ISA for being first-of-all an international, student-oriented and open association. This is something we definitely shouldnï¿½t forget about.This is especially important, because itï¿½s the Annual Conference of the ISA plus its 40th anniversary celebration, therefore we should celebrate our values and bliefs.     I think this is also what a lot of board members wanted to see, and finally they will evaluate us. I think our discuorse somehow reflects the basic trade-off in the ISA. On the one hand side we need companies to attract students and on the other side we need talented students to attract companies. But the thing we could influence most with the conference is to attract talented students. And I think the most interesting ones will be those, which are also interested in working for or being part of an international association. Therefore we should attract there interest by showing the internationality of our association. This will also give the companies the chance to see what the ISA is about, and might probably impress them to, for seeing something especially international and not everyday like in Russia. Finally I'm convinced, if we can manage to attract the most talented students, the companies definetely will follow. Therefore I would really appreciate, if we might find a solution which might include an international buffet and probably an international music act.   Thereby especially the Catering is very important to me. Iï¿½m really afraid that especially our international guest (including board members) might probably donï¿½t like the Russian cuisine. If they donï¿½t like it they will definitely wonï¿½t feel comfortable, which might destroy the whole atmosphere. Thereby I think we take a risk, which we donï¿½t need to take. We should rather use the international buffet as sign for the internationality of our association and the diversity of task and opportunities in our association. I understand your doubts, that the communication at the tables might be disturbed. But I think the primary aim of the event is to get in contact with a lot of people, especially with regards to the aim of acquiring new members. It will be quite hard to talk to many people, if you have to sit for several hours on the table talking to just a few persons. Furthermore standing in row at the buffet is always a very good chance to get into contact to new people. I see that our board will have to lead deep conversations with the companies, but Iï¿½m optimistic, that this will also work, because the companies are as well interested in the ISA, therefore they will definitely search the contact. Basically I think a dinner with Russian Cuisine is a good idea, but not for an event of this size.  But we can propose a dinner for a smaller event for showing special partners the interest of the ISA in the Russian culture. For an Event of this size, I think, we should ensure everybody will find something that he likes, and therefore the international buffet in my opinion is really important and definitely the best choice. About the Music Act, we might probably talk, but to be honest, I would also appreciate an international act.   Iï¿½m glad you stated talking about the sponsor selection. This is the most important point from my point of few, not because of the atmosphere, but because of the financing and long-term strategy with our sponsors. Here the offering of a long-term contract with Boomerang is really tempting especially in terms of future security. But we have to take care.   With Art Inc. we have got a long-term relation, that shouldnï¿½t be under evaluated. They supported us in the past very constantly and generously. This is the reason for the high offer. Furthermore I see no point why they should change their mind in future, as long as we donï¿½t do anything that disgraces them. Boomerang is a direct competitor of Art Inc, which means if we choose them, we will definitely lose Art Inc. Therefore In my opinion the best strategy might be to choose Art Inc., but we have to negotiate with them to strive for a long-term agreement with them in the future. The fact, that now there is interest of other companies, which are direct competitors to Art Inc., will definitely support that strategy. Therefore I think this yearï¿½s conference wonï¿½t be the time for the change. But next year we need to strive for the long-term contract with Art Inc.. Otherwise we might look for companies that are not direct competitors to Art Inc. to hold them and achieve a long-term sponsor.   I know this information might be quite contradictive to your offer, but the sponsor selection and the catering are really important points for me. Therefor I offer you to choose quite freely the Presentation tasks and Iï¿½m also might be open to other proposals regard the Music act.     Iï¿½m looking forward to hear from you. Best regards   Alex  
Hey Alex, thank you for your ideas and thoughts, really appreciate that! Sry for the delay, I wasn't able to answer you sooner. Your approach to show something different sounds really good, so I'm ok with your decision to prepare an international buffet. As you already figured out, many different people can get in touch while waiting in the queue. On the other hand it's very important for me not to offend our Russian participants by overwhelming them with too much internationality. In other words we should honor their culture and tradation, therefore at least a local Russian band should be considered! This is not negotiable! Thank you for your offer choosing the presentation tasks quite freely, I'd love to do the opening speech! Regarding the sponsor selection, I'm not glad to hear that your decision is to take Art Inc.. However if the music act and the presentation task won't be changed anymore, I'm fine with Art. Inc. I hope that it will be not a mistake to take Art Inc., but we will see next year... Best regards, Chris
"Hey Chris, No problem due to the delay! I'm really glad, that you accept Art Inc. as sponsor, thank you for that. I also appriciate the acceptance of the international buffet. For me those were the most important points as I already explained to you. I understand that this might be a hard compromise for you. Therefore I'm definitely okay to make the compromise regarding the presentation tasks and the Music Act. Finally I'm really pleased with the compromise to choose a russian band and the international buffet. I think this will be quite a good mix of local and international aspects and I'm opitimistic, that they will ensure a great atmosphere. I defenitely have to refresh my Kalinka dance skills;). I think with our approach we will definitely have got a good chance to convince the board. I think they will also be pleased to see, that we mangaged to combine international and local aspects. So thank you very much for your cooperation. I think we'll now have a good base for the further planing steps. Best regards Alex      "
Good afternoon Chris! My name is Alex and I know you are interested in organizing and planning the event of ISA. I think we can talk about our terms and we can reach an agreement. My first offer is that you attached below. Should you disagree with any of the points I'd like to let me know and try to reach an agreement. Best regards, Aex.
Hallo Alex, thanks for getting in contact! I also heard that we are on the team to organize the event of ISA in Russia and I hope weï¿½ll have a good time preparing a great event. I would like to know how you feel about the Music Act: DJ Happy. Could you explain why you are interested in DJ Happy to perform the music act. I heard that Russians prefer local folkore music and it might distract from the real purpose of the event if we invite DJ Happy. Best Regards, Mattias
Well, it is true the event is in Russia but not only Russians are going to the event because the event is for the ISA, so I prupose DJ Happy  because he is a very famous DJ that regularly fills huge venues with his events aand I am sure that his presence will attract many guests. On the other hand I don't think that a local folklore band will be the best way, because they are not very familiar with international events. And what do you think about the other points? for example the Catering? Regards, Alex.
Hello Alex, thanks for your reply. I think that I will be fine with the choice of the DJ Act, if we find a better solution for the Catering: International buffet It would show more appreciation to our Russian members and guests and if we take a local russian cuisine instead of an international buffet, because we expect important people who expect a certain level of formality which a buffet can not fit.   Best regards, Mattias
Good afternoon Chris, considering the issue of catering I am not convinced that the best option is a Russian menu because there will be a lot of foreign people and I do not think they will used to this kind of food, plus these foods are usually strong and do not think that is as appropriate for the audience that later have to participate in the various events that are made, that is why I proposed the international Buffet because that each person can choose the dish they want and take their taste menus and more light. Other points that we need to clarify that reference is the week that we choose to celebrate the event and how we are going to organize the initial speech and awards. I hope news and answers soon.   Regards, Alex.
Hello Alex!   I see that you have fixed your position to take internationl dj and buffet. I consider to take at least another sponsor because of the relationship and the money we get for our event and to take the other catering. I'm feel good with the date of the conference and i will take a step to you that we take the international dj and that you get the openeing speech. Although the speech is a higher risk because of the importance that the ISA get the Russians to be a new subsidiary.   Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, first I do not think there valued at one hundred percent the idea of food as only suggests a kind of food, which, if people can not have certain foods will be limited to lunch and given I do not think we can agree. We could appreciate the fact International three corse meal option. Secondly I do not think we should change Art Inc. as Sponsor because it is the sponsor for which we have always earned, and while expensive, it has always been successful. Moreover, as I said earlier it has always been a reference to the entity and carries a lifetime with us. Finally, I have understood that you agree with I made the initial speech and you make the awards but you have said too there's a lot of responsibility. If you like you can do the initial speech and I can give the awards. Therefore the new offer I propose is that I attach below. Greeting,   Alex.
Hi Alex, I would appreciate if you do not underestimate the importance of a new subsidiary in Russia, which the ISA really need. Therefore we should think about at least the Catering to take the local Russian cuisine instead of the international food, which we take at ISA internal events only, to serve the Russian participants the necessary respect, because we take a international DJ instead of a local one. As you mentioned the opening speech, I would like to know why you recline the opening speech? Best regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, In replay to your email, I have considered your proposal but I do not agree with some of your ideas. I have changed my mind with the initial speech because you told me, in the previous email, which it was very important. So I give you the opportunity to do it, and I perceive that you are very confident in.  Return I would like to re-think the issue of catering and taking into account the option of International three course meal, because this possibility gives you the opportunity to change the dishes if a dish does not like or can not eat.   Regards, Alex.
Hello Alex, In my mind, you disagree with all of my passions to bring the Russian culture into this ISA event, which takes actually place in Russia. This is obviously the reason, because the ISA wants to have a subsidiary in Russia and this should be the result of the event. Therefore we should think about the getting some Russian culture into the organization, which is only possible in the Catering type of the Music Act, please consider this. As I think, that you are really into the Music Act and the Sponsor, I would suggest to take at least a Russian food.   Best Regards, Chris
Dear Chris, responding to your message and trying to reach a final agreement, I agree that the catering is that you propose (although in the event will be people from more nations besides Russia) but in return, I want to return to my original position: I do the initial speech and you give the awards. Regards,   Alex.
Hi Alex, I'm very glad that you have seen that a more Russia like food will fit more in an Russian event, because we want to establish a subsidiary in Russia and thats the whole thing about this event. But in a more private thing, I would appreciate if I could take the opening speech because there is a chance to get a job at ISA for those team members who are the best organizers and furthermore i held more often a speech at ISA events before which is an advantage for us, is that possible for you?   Best Regards, Chris
Hi Chris! Now that we have cleared almost all points, I would like you agreed to give me the initial speech. I would like to express the work we have both done on this event and thank the association time, dedication and development performing every year. So I ask you to let me make the initial speech. Thanks for your time, Alex.      
Hi Alex, I'm okay with the agreement, thanks for your pariticpation and I'm glad that we reached an agreement which fits nearly our conception. Best Regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, At first I want to say, that I hope our cooperation will be successful. Because of the high amount of other people taking part at the competition, I think it is essential, that we find solutions which satisfies as well both of us as the ISA, too. Therefore I am sending you my opening offer, which is as follows: For the presentation task I would offer that I am taking the part of the opening speech, and you are doing the presentation of the awards. To this point, I have to add, that I am a very experienced speaker. I had some speeches in front of many listeners, so I wonï¿½t be nervous, when holding the speech. Additionally I think itï¿½s a big chance for you, if you present the awards. You get in contact with some of the most important people of the ISA. So I think this would be a fair share of this task. My second point is the choice of the sponsor. As you might know the ISA is having a long partnership with Art Inc.. Therefore I think, that we should continue our partnership with them. If we consider the amount of money they are willing to pay, this is more than of any of the other competitors. In the past they were a reliable partner for the ISA, so I think they will be one in the future, too. The next point we have to discuss together is the music act, which will play at the conference. In my opinion DJ Happy would be a great choice. Nearly all of his concerts are sold out, so thatï¿½s why I think he would be a great support for the conference. He would make sure, that the event gets very popular, and because of that the performance of him, he would also attract many people. Especially possible business partners of the ISA. The catering is also a major point in the planning of the conference. Because of the international guests, I would suggest to have mostly international food, which approves for most of the people. The form of the meal is also an important point. As you know the conferences of the ISA are in a relaxed atmosphere, where everyone should be able to get in contact with as many people as possible. So therefore I think that an international buffet, would fit these requirements best. The last point we have to talk about is the date of the conference. At first I have to make sure, that you know, that I think week 2 and week 5 shouldnï¿½t even considered. In week 2 some of the important members of the ISA wonï¿½t be able to join the conference, and I think if we would suggest this week as date of the conference, then our suggestion for the conference wonï¿½t even be considered. Also the week 5 is no option in my opinion. This week is too close to the Christmas holiday, and therefore many people wonï¿½t be able to attend the conference because they rather spent their Christmas holidays with their families, than join a conference in Moscow. So in my opinion I would suggest Week 3 for the conference. Because in this week, there are no limitations like in week 2 or 5. At last, I have to say, that I am really looking forward to your answer and hope you appreciate my offer. Best regards   Alex
Hello Alex, I guess it would be better to chose a local russian band! We both want the event to become a success. When such a famous star as DJ Happy is perfoming on this event, it will totaly overshadow our real objectives to promote ISA and improve our image right?  Therefore I would like to suggest a russian band. Please let me know what you think about this and if we could arrange a compromise. Best regards! Chris
Dear Chris, At first I want to thank you for your answer. I think this is a solid basis, and we can find an agreement soon. But there is still one point, we have to talk about. Concretely this is Music Act: FreeLife. I understand your concerns about DJ Happy, and think you're right. He would overshadow the conference. But instead of the local russian band, I would suggest to engage the pop band FreeLife. They fit well with the aims of the ISA. And in contrast to DJ Happy they are not so famous that they may overshadow what the conference is about. Namely about the anniversary of the ISA and the new office in Moscow. Additionally I think that a local russian band is not that good for an international event like this. Don't forget, in the last years the guests of the conferences often were bored during the music act. Therefore I think it's better to choose some act, which is a little bit more popular and well known. I hope to hear from you soon. Best regards Alex
Greetings Alex, your explaination is pretty plausible and I guess you are right: FreeLife would be a good solution for our purposes, so I agree with you as ISA is an highly international organization, and surely need to stress this as it is one of major attributes. Nevertheless, this year`s conference is a bit special: We are celebrating our 40th anniversary and even more important, after the failed attempt in 2004, the newest member country of our organization: Russia. In my opinion, we need a way to show our appreciation of Russian culture. Especially our future Russian business contacts will honor that. I suggest we stick to the local russian band and server an International three course meal. Otherwise, and as you also brought a good point, I would also agree on serving local Russian cuisine and FreeLife as Music Act.Please let me know what you think about those two alternatives. Best regards Chris      
Dear Chris,   I understand your point and think you are right. We have to impress the russian business contacs, therefore I agree that it is necessary to place some parts of the russian culture in our conference. But as you already mentioned, the ISA is a highly international organization, and in my opinion that's why it is not possible to renounce at the international buffet. For me this is not really an option, because I think it is absolutely necessary that the guests are pleased with the catering. Rather I would change the music act. Therefore I am suggesting you a third alternative. This is an alternative you already came up with. So I am offering you to have a local russian band as music act. I hope you appreciate my offer and we can find an agreement soon.   Best regards Alex
Hi Alex, I appreciate that you share my thoughts on this issue, but then I really suggest to serve the international three course meal. Anything less than that would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years, which werenï¿½t even some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversary and thus would harm the prestige of the ISA. Considering the selection of a sponsor. Boomerang made a very good offer but offered slightly less money for the event then Art Inc. However, they also said that they would be willing to sign a long-term contract. I guess this would bring us two much more good reputation to chose a sponsoring partner, who is willing and able to help us organize also future events!  Best regards Chris  
Dear Alex, thanks for your counteroffer. But I will not accept this offer. Firstly, the choice of the sponsor: We should consider that Art Inc. and the ISA had a long partnership. If we continue working together with them as the sponsor of the ISA, then this would also show the russian business organizations, and any other organizations, which are interested in a cooperation with the ISA, that the ISA cares for their longterm partners. In my opinion this will attract more organizations. Because of that we should not only consider what they pay and for how long they offer the contract. Secondly, do you really think a three course meal is fitting to the atmosphere of the conference? As you know of the last years events, one of the aims of this conference is to get in contact with a lot of people. This is easier if you have a relaxed atmosphere, that you get when you have a buffet. During a buffet everyone is able to walk around and to talk to new people. Best regards Alex
Hello Alex, (your name is Alex, see your last offer :-) ) this absolutely not possible. When you demanding a buffet for communication reasons solely, you forget that the whole conference is about networking. To itensify your relationships, a three course meal is he perfect opportunity. Not to mention the points I said in my last offer. When you really want to serve the buffet, we have to make a compromise on the sponsor. Otherwise I see our reputation as repsonisible, future-minded planners of this event seriously dangered. Best regards Chris
"Dear Chris, why is it not possible to accept my last offer with: Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. ? You already made that offer. Therefore I don't understand why you now consider this offer as ""absolutely not possible"". Best regards Alex  "
Hi Alex, at the first response offer I only took the Music Act into Account, to discuss the other topics later. I think an offer is not meant to be final. To not change a category doesn`t mean I agree with that but, to discuss that later on. Best Chris  
Dear Chris, even though you said that an offer is not meant to be final, I was and am able to accept your first offer. If you don't want to agree on special topics, then you should either leave a blank space or chose the alternative you want. But back to our topic: For me it is no option to select Boomerang as the sponsor of the ISA. For two reasons: firstly Art Inc. pays more than Boomerang, and secondly the ISA has had no partnership with the ISA yet, in contrast to the Art Inc. So what kind of impression to other organizations and companies would it be, if we would accept the offer of a sponsor which pays less and was until now no partner of the ISA? Therefore I just can repeat my previous offer.   Best regards Alex
Hi Alex, well, good then, so can we agree on the International three course meal then as a compromise? Seems like a good solution for us both. Otherwise we could talk about the distribution of the speech. Best regards Chris
Dear Chris, your offer sounds interesting. But I want to know what you would say about the distribution of the speech? Best regards Alex
Hi Alex, well, if we keep the Int. Buffet we could agree on this: I hold the speech and you announce and present this year`s awards. What do you think of this? Best regards Chris
Dear Chris, I am content with your offer, therefore I accept it. With these chosen parameters, I think we will have a good chance to win the contest. Thanks for cooperation. Best regards Alex
Hi Chris! As you might have already heard, we are in a team to plan this years ISA's 40th anniversary combined with the celebration of the newly established subsidary in Saint Petersburg, Russia.   I am looking forward to woking with you in a team! I'm sure, we will do great together and I hope we will agree on all diffrerent aspects easily. Team performance will be very important to create a successfull event! :) Thinking about the catering aspect, I would suggest an inernational buffet, to ensure a fluent conversation between all members. If dinner is being served at the table, people wont't really get in touch with each other. And since the members come from all over the world (and since it is not only about the establishment in Russia), we should arrange everything in a more international way. I hope, you'll agree on this. I think, the date of the conference will be the best one in week 3. This is due to the fact that our ISA leading members won't be able to attend in week 2. And during week 1, our conference would collide with the International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow. Week 4 and 5 is very close to Christmas, this could cause some trouble for certain members. As a sponsor, I would suggest hiring the Art Inc., because they made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly of the event and the ISA does have a very long and positive history with them. Booerang offered slightly less money for the event. Corporated Ltd. and Documenta made lower offers than Art Inc. and Boomerang. So from my point of view, Arc Inc. will be the perfect sponsor! I am looking forward to hearing from you soon to get everything started as soon as possible. Kindly, Alex                      
Hey Alex, I am kinda busy at the moment, I just received a message that if I don't respond now, I'd be kicked out of the system... so this is me responding :) I'll read your message later today and I will give you my take on that ASAP. Best regards, Chris 
Hi Chris,  since you are not able to respond to your own message, I write you now hoping to get an answer this evening to get our negotiation started! Thank you. Alex
"Hello Alex, Sorry for the waiting. I considered your offer you made. Here's my take on that. Russia is an orthodox country and the Christmas is 7th of January. So except for few international guests, nobody minds if we make it 4th or 5th week. But let's leave it at Date of Conference: Week 3  as you asked, as long as you are open to change the opinion on the catering. Here are my arguments on that.  Catering: local Russian cuisine  would be the best option, since we will have a lot of guests who are our potential business partners, like CEOs and celebrities. Can you imagine a guy like Roman Abramovich waiting in line at the buffey to pick up the meatballs? :))) About the conversation, I don't really see the correlation between what you eat and the level on conversation. For me it doesn't matter if I'm eating sushi or schnitzel, the only thing what's important is the dialog partner. I see this event as an oportunity to present Russia in the best possible way, that's why I'm suggesting Music Act: Local Russian band  . Remember the Sochi Olimpic Games? If it was Putin's opinion to make the Olimpic Games all about presenting Russian heritage to the world, why would we make it any different?! Plus, our other options like DJ Happy and FeelLife are not suitable for our purpose. Popular DJs are every week in some club in St. Petersburg and it would be like night out in the club, not opening of a student association. FreeLife is boy band who's considered very gay in Russia, so getting them will bring us media controversies even from the start. Plus, local band would cost a lot cheaper than flying some ""hot-shot"" celebrities from Hollywood or whatever... Best, Chris  "
"Dear Chris,  thank you for writing. I think, you're not really aware of the worldï¿½s opinion about Russia's political standing in general. I guess, FreeLife being considered a homosexual boy band is only rumour. And if not, so what? :) Russia is still very obsolete about these aspects and it's time to chance the country's image! This is not a contemporary and broad-minded opinion we should support. It's high time for Russia to get integrated into adequate social opinions. So with DJ Happy as a musician act we can only win. This brings us a modern image and as his act contains mainly English speaking songs, everyone is able to understand the text. Otherwise some non-russian speaking people might feel excluded. I would suggest a compromise: we take DJ Happy and suggest him to play some Russian songs in between, to get a tough of Russian atmosphere. Wouldn't that be a good one? :) Next point. I think, week 3 is suitable best for you as well. In fact, this wouldn't really be a compromise you make. Most Russian upper class families in big metropolises like Saint Petersburg, so also the leading ISA membersï¿½ families, already adapted to a western behaviour and to the western way of life. They also like to have friendships to western people. This is why many of them started to celebrate Christmas on December 25. So letï¿½s don't make it more complicated than necessary and keep week 3 without dealing it as a compromise. ;) About the catering I don't feel comfortable with only a Russian local cuisine. I mean, we don't have to serve meatballs at the buffet. It still can be high class food! We could offer a mixture of different types of food. I am thinking about arranging it in different areas according to several countries being contained in the ISA. So everybody can chose what he or she wants to! I think that will be great! And you will have the Russian food as well. Just as you wanted. But serving at the table is so stiff and rigid. Roman Abramovitch will not attend the event since he is not an ISA member. ;) And all the others, even though they might be in leading positions, are finally people like you and me. I'm sure they like being treated like it's common to treat everyone at ISA.  What do you think about the offer I made respective the sponsor? Is this okay for you? Maybe you can reread my plausible arguments in my first message to you. :) I also hope, youï¿½re okay with me giving the opening speech and you awarding the ISA members. I am attending a rhetorical course at university at the moment and for the final exam I need a practising performance to show in class. I arranged to take a video of my speech by someone, so it would be great if you could trust me on that. Giving the awards is an as important role as it is to give the speech, so everyone of us has his time of audience. If you help me with that, I will be very greatful. Maybe we could talk about choosing Boomerang as a sponsor, this would be my concession to you.  It would be great to get an answer to the points I made this afternoon. Kindly, Alex      "
"This feels less like a negotiation, more like your Christmas wish list and you find arguments to suit your needs. Try to be reasonable. My name might be Chris, but I'm not Father Christmas ;)"
Hallo Chris, I'm feeling disappointed by your way of negotiating. We both have the aim to create a successful conference event and I think this not going to work if you don't refer to any of my last offers. I ask you again to write some adequate counferoffers so we can get a suitable basis for closing our negotiation. Thank you. Alex
Hey! for the sake of the event, here is an offer, as simple as possible. You get Date of Conference: Week 3  and Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  , I get Music Act: Local Russian band  and Catering: local Russian cuisine . Bonus for you, you get Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  , so you get the main part in the show. I expect from you to accept is, since it was generous in my opinion and according to my calculations. We both lose if you don't accept. Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, since time is pressuring, I will accept your offer, althought this has never been a real negotiation. Kind regards, Alex  
Dear Chris, As we have already settled some issues for  the conference together, I am looking forward to find a common solution regarding the remaining aspects. If we work onward together and find a consensus for the outstanding issues, I am very hopeful that we have good chances to win the competition. Please find enclosed my proposal for the following outstanding aspects for the conference: For the sponsor selection I think that the choice is really clear and simple. Art Inc. as our long-term partner to whom we had always a good relationship should be the representative sponsor of the event.   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   The next outstanding aspect is the music act. It is very important to create a good atmosphere, because this represents the frame of the conference. DJ Happy would be the suitable and best solution in my opinion. Such a famous and international act would capture the attention of lots of young talents in the region.   Music Act: DJ Happy   The next point, the opening ceremony, we could organise as follows: You will have the unique chance to announce the winner of the yearly ISA award. A great honour and pleasure for you to perform the handing out of the certificates.  I would do the speech of the organisers in the opening ceremony. A good share of the tasks in this part.   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Furthermore, we have to fix the exact date of the conference. A very important aspect in my opinion, because time is a serious issue. I would propose the third week. This time slot is less conflicting with other events.   Date of Conference: Week 3   Lastly, the catering is another remaining unresolved issue. The most appropriate approach would be international buffet. This kind of meal fits perfectly for the atmosphere which ISA needs for the conference.   Catering: International buffet     I hope you will agree with my proposals for the outstanding aspects for the conference. I am really interested to find a common solution for the rest of our organisation task. By our common efforts we were quite successful and we are on the best way. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. I would really like to hear your point of view on my offer. I wish you a nice day. With best regards, Alex
"Deer Alex, Greetings!   I am glad that you are writing me regarding the ISA conference issues which shows your dedication and commitment! Although, I regret to inform you that our concepts differ, but we are certainly on the right track. As for the Sponsor selection, Art Inc. is a well-known name to us which we used to have deals before, however, I personally have bad experiences with Art Inc. which is irrelevant to discuss here, but lucky enough Boomerang offered us a deal which is way better than Art Inc, it is safe to go with them.  I am going straight forward to the point, I have much more experiences in hosting events, specifically related to the Russian community since my root goes back to there!! I can assure you if there are two things Russians hate, the first is to listen to Moder Music performed by Djs. Now we do not want to make the local community feel uncomfortable do we? After all, they are the majority of our audience. Regarding the Date of Conference, I unfortunately cannot comment on that currently, but we will get back to this no worries. As for the catering, remember I told you about ""two things that Russians hate""? Yes correct, the second is to have a meal served as a buffet in front of them. What is the point of serving a buffet to a community which are not that flexible towards new experiences and cultures, I can assure you it is going to end up like a disaster with tons of remaining untouched food which we have to eventually throw away. Safest option here is to keep it simple and just go for a local Russian cuisine, which everyone loves and will 100% please the majority of our audience. Regarding the presentation task, as much as I respect your work and commitment Alex and as much as I would love to take over the second part, but sometimes you got to accept the facts on the table.  Fact is, this event is one of the most important events for ISA due to its uniqueness, if (god forbid) me and you fail in hosting this we can certainly both forget about our future. Logically, everything needs to go smoothly and flawless and even the smallest mistake will end up as our biggest regret. Now I am sure we both do not want this. As you might  know, an opening speech is very stressful since you are the first person to talk and all the pressure is on you, please consider us as a team and take one for the team, with my experience I can assure you everything runs smooth for the opening speech and you will have the blessing to announce the winners.  I am looking forward to hear from you. Regards, Chris    "
Dear Chris, After some reflections on your last offer, I think it is necessary to make some alterations in order to find a way for a successful cooperation. I have read your argumentation carefully and have also seriously thought about it. I am very pleased about your engagement and ambition. Nevertheless, I regret that I canï¿½t accept the conditions that you proposed in your counter offer in that way. Although our opinions differ in some aspects, I am highly optimistic that we will find a common solution in our team challenge. Therefore, I would like to renegotiate certain issues and present you my point of view and arguments slightly better. For the sponsor selection I agree, that Art Inc., as well as Boomerang, are in the closer selection and the others can be excluded from the selection. However, it is obvious that Art Inc. made the much better offer in terms of a short-term payment. And exactly this short-term liquid funds are most important for our event. I can tell you with my good background knowledge and experiences in finance, that we need this money urgently. Furthermore, our good relationship with Art Inc. should be considered when we make this decision. They have supported us for a very long time and they receive the acceptance. Art Inc. will continue their support in the future. Therefore we should stay with Art Inc.. Long-term relationships are that important in the modern environment of today.   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   In case of the music act, I had to notice that we have widely differing points of view. I canï¿½t really follow your argumentation in this case, because in my opinion you canï¿½t generalize that all Russians hate modern music and catering. Your remark may apply for the elder generation of Russia. But exactly this is the crux of the matter. I also collected several experiences when I was serving different projects, especially with young Russians. In particular the younger people like to listen to modern music. And these young future talents represent the core of our event. If we can get students ï¿½ the future talents ï¿½ interested in the ISA, then the business partners will automatically work with the ISA to get easier access to these talents. Therefore I would still go with DJ Happy. I think the local Russian band is definitely contrary to the values of ISA and our CEO, Dr. Roman Illenschitz, would not support this. Maybe the third alternativ would represent a compromise, but you have to think about my proposal carerfully.   Music Act: DJ Happy   The same as for the music applies for the selection of the food. It is fact, that many of the guests are unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, as we are organizing an international event. We canï¿½t provide those local specialties for such a multi-cultural event ï¿½ this would be highly inappropriate. Concerning the ï¿½tons of remaining untouched foodï¿½ which you mentioned, we have eventually to throw away, I can definitely calm you down. I have talked to the caterer of the international buffet and he has lots of experiences in catering. He is well-known for his great calculating and estimating of his purchase orders. This would be no problem. Catering: International buffet   If you would comply with me in the catering aspect, I can offer you my accommodation in the presentation tasks. If we canï¿½t find a common solution, what would be about an external speaker? This could be really beneficial for our event. As we obviously both want to get the opening speech, because it is very prestigious, it is really difficult to share the two presentation tasks of the opening ceremony. It is the biggest honor of the evening and the speaker of the opening speech has the perfect place to reach a broad audience and to leave a lasting impression. I would only really unwillingly do without this. You really have to comply highly in the catering aspect to change my mind. Maybe you accept my concession there and I offer to negotiate about you to give the opening speech. But this would be a big step and damage for me.   Presentation Tasks: Third person   For the last point, the date of the conference, I am really happy, that we are here on the same level. This represents a solid basis for our further negotiations. However, it became clear to me, that we both have to make some admissions and work as a team to find a consensus. But I am still very optimistic. I hope that my arguments have convinced you. Otherwise, I am looking forward to your new offer. Date of Conference: Week 3   With kind regards, Alex
"Deer Alex,   Thanks for writing me again. As you already said, Art Inc. used to be our all-time favorite in prior events and I personally have worked with them numerous times. The problem is that although they always offer a quick short-time payment, they will end up delaying the payments due to tax related issues. 9 out of 10 times they e-mailed us that the payment will be delayed to the beginning of the next month, but the transaction would never be completed and always get delayed again. I do not like their unprofessionalism and by doing deals with them again we are only encouraging them. I rather sacrifice the promised ï¿½quick paymentï¿½ (which never happens) and go for the late, but way safer option provided by Boomerang. With my calculations and experience, we 100% will not have issues in hosting the event using other reserved funds which I have from the prior events. Guaranteed.   As you also said, this event is a multinational event with numerous participants. DJ happy might be entertaining for the younger generation but you have to think about our target audience. Is it the young students who have no financial benefit for our organization or is it the higher authorities of Russian who will end up having deals with our organization. Also I would like to remind you that Dr. Illenschitz is going to be in the audience and he certainly will evaluate our work as well, I am 100% sure that he personally will not be entertained with Modern songs and he would also appreciate to not lower the standards of his event with some unknown DJ (Pardon for me being a bit straight forward).   Imagine yourself going to a huge event in India, what would you rather see on the table? The usual everyday food which you can personally cook at home and also eat for 3 times per-day at your hotel, or would you rather eat some excellent tasty Indian food prepared by the locals and spice out your day! After all, we have to consider the local culture of the place which we are organizing our event. In addition, do not forget our target audience which are the Russians whom we shall impress.   Now regarding the presentation. I regret to inform you that I cannot agree with you on hiring a third-party person. ISAï¿½s specialty was always to be an organization hosted by students for students; it is in our slogan that we have always been independent and we shall always remain independent as well. As a matter of fact, I have never assigned a task to a person outside my group and I am not willing to do this now as well. Especially since we both have the opportunity to show our skills to Dr. Illenschitz. You mentioned that ï¿½we both want to get the opening speechï¿½, this tells me that your perception about me and about what we are doing to do here is wrong. Alex this is not about you and not about me, this is not a race who is going to end up with a winner and a loser, we both have to sacrifice some of our personal gains in order to win this as a team, please remember that our goal is to deliver a successful and entertaining event for our audience. Believe me on this, if you were the person with more experience among us I would gladly let you do the opening speech without hesitation! I worked really hard to reach a level which I feel comfortable to cope with the pressure of talking in front of a massive audience. I am sure that with time you are going to gain this skill as well. Take this as an opportunity and announce the winners, it will be a new experience for you which improves your skills and you can also prove yourself to the ISA community!   Sincerely,   Chris"
Dear Chris, First of all, thanks for your detailed presentation of your point of view once more. Unfortunately your last offer didn't get this negotiation any further in my point of view. Please try to make also some concessions to enable me to do so. I really appreciate your enthusiasm in arguing, but we have to stick to the facts, especially in case of the sponsor selection. And fact is, that the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event is the one of Art Inc.. At this point, I would also clear the rumour with the delayed payments. This fact and the so called ï¿½unprofessionalismï¿½ by Art Inc. isnï¿½t proved by the finance division. Whereas you made some negative experiences with Art Inc. , my former encounters with Art Inc. were throughout positive. And furthermore good supplier relationships gain increasingly in importance nowadays. The supplier relationship management constitutes a precious value in our organization. Nonetheless, we will not approach each other this way and our project is in danger to become a fail. Even so, I am still willing to change my mind at this point, if you would make on your part some concessions on the remaining aspects. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   In general, I canï¿½t hide, that I am kind of disappointed about your last offer. While I was looking for a joint solution, I had to recognize, that you made no movement and you have shown no sign of team working. Please remember the central idea of ISA. Students working communicative and cooperative together. Therefore, we have to discuss again about the music act. You mentioned that Dr. Illenschitz would not prefer DJ Happy as a music act. But also at the same time, I am equally convinced, that he wouldï¿½t prefer a local Russian band representing his organization. Having a local band play at such an event, does definitely not fit the character of an international associationï¿½s meeting. This wonï¿½t be appropriate. I am clearly opting for a more international orientation of the music act. For this reason, I am offering you as a compromise the selection of the Pop band FreeLife. But please notice, that DJ Happy is still my preferred choice, but I as a concession I am offering you this kind of trade-off. Moreover when you were talking about an ï¿½unknown DJï¿½, I have to correct you unfortunately once again: DJ Happy is one of the most famous performers. This DJ regularly fills huge venues with his events and I am sure that his presence would attract many guests, which could then in turn be interested in the ISA. As I already said, we have to stick to the facts.   Music Act: FreeLife   Regarding the catering, I am still persisting to go with an international buffet. I would like to remind you of the earlier attempt to establish an office in Moscow, which had failed in 2004. I would not say that the wrong catering was the reason at that time, but the food has certainly contributed to this fact. The Catering and music in 2004 was not appropriate. We canï¿½t stick always to these old patterns. In the meantime the globalization advanced a huge step further and the multi-cultural conference definitely needs an international touch. Having a buffet during which you would be free to move around and talk while eating would be much more relaxed. And the Russian society is still prepared for this kind of catering. They are no more old-fashioned, they are also characterized by modern influences. Catering: International buffet   Last thing to talk about is the presentation task. Let me say, that I am willing to listen to your advice not to hire a third person. I comprehended your argumentation and we should decide only between the two of us. We should definitely take the chance to show our skills to Dr. Illenschitz. But let me clarify to you, that I am certainly not considering our organization challenge as a competition between the two of us. I am really willing to deliver a great performance as a team ï¿½ a team of both of us. But team working means to ï¿½give and take, Chris. We have to corporate and succeed our dream. So far, I am the only person in our team, who is performing as a unit. So far, I canï¿½t see a major deficit in holding speeches compared with you. I also had several opportunities in recent times to talk in front of audiences of this size and I am working really hard to improve my skills onwards. Therefore I will offer you to share the activities. I would do half of the opening speech and half of the awards ceremony, while you, Chris, perform the other half. This would be a quite good compromise. Presentation Tasks: Shared activities   Chris, please note, that I made you with this two main concessions for our organization task. Furthermore I would be under specific circumstances willing to change my mind in a third aspect, the sponsor selection. But these concessions are only relevant, if you are also willing to cooperate. Only then a good collaboration is possible.   Date of Conference: Week 3   Please keep in mind, that this yearï¿½s competition is especially important to the ISA and due to the fail in Moscow 2004 last time, I canï¿½t accept your offer on the whole. Please remember, that ISA made the same mistakes in those days, you are offering me right now.   I look forward to hearing from you soon. Best regards, Alex
Greetings alex, I am pleased to see how committed you are to this task but again sadly I am unable to accept your offer again. I am glad to hear that you had a good experience with Art Inc. but as I already explained I personally did not, and I am not willing to voluntarily go into their trap again. What is the point of doing mistakes if you do not learn out of them? It was a true mistake to have a deal with them. In addition, as I mentioned, Boomerang promised us a long-term relationship with even more benefits than Art Inc. hence it is an opportunity which we should not miss. Letï¿½s write down the facts and compare both of the sponsors shall we? Art inc. Pros: 1-    Quick payment 2-    long-term contract and support Art Inc. cons: 1-    Not being trustworthy 2-    Proven their unprofessionalism numerous times Now in contrast: Boomerang Pros: 1-    Long-term contract and support 2-    BETTER benefits than Art inc. Boomerang Cons: 1-    Slightly less short-time offer ONLY FOR THE FIRST TIME   So as you can see, there is literally no point in choosing Art inc. over Boomerang. As I mentioned in my previous offer, I will take care of the finances from the additional budget that we could gather from the previous projects. This is a onetime only/limited offer provided by Boomerang which we will never receive again if we donï¿½t go for it hence, I still insist and I will be insisting on selecting this sponsor. You are currently looking at this issue from a short-term perspective, please remember that the first crucial rule in Project management it to look at everything from a ï¿½long-runï¿½ perspective regardless of their short-term consequences. Also keep in mind, these are sponsors who we select. In return, we have to make banners and advertisements of them on the podium and such. I am not willing to advertise or recommend an unethical and unprofessional company to my audience, I am sincerely sorry but this is just not me and I am not going to do that since they offer a slightly better short-term payment!  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Regarding the catering, as a matter of fact if you check the previous documents, every single ISA event (local or international) used to serve at least three course meal to their audience. Anything below that is a big no since it is a downgrade compared to the previous events. Again, you have to keep in mind who our target audience is and who we are trying to please! A buffet is certainly not formal enough for the 40th ISA anniversary, but on the other hand I do agree with you on the part that we should try to keep this more international hence I suggest let us agree on having a Three course meal. Catering: International three course meal   Regarding the music act, again I would like to remain you about our main target which we need to focus during our discussion: Pleasing the Russians. Project management aside, letï¿½s think about this issue from a marketing perspective, ISA desires to establish connections in Russia in order to expand their business how are we able to do this? You have mentioned that last year there was a failure in doing so, do you know why? The reason was the ISA did not have enough connections in Russia hence they failed. Having a Russian local band proves our respect towards Russian culture and hopefully results in a better engagement with the community hence I still insist on hiring a local band rather than mainstream DJs. Music Act: Local Russian band   Alex, I would like to remind you again, I am not arguing simply because it is a pleasure for me. As a matter of fact, I honestly wish we could make a final decision on the flow of the event and directly go to the executive process. What I am trying to do here is to simply deliver the best experience to our audience and create as many connections as possible! I am sorry to be a bit strict and forward to this, but your arguments poor and I would definitely consider valid and strong arguments based on facts! To be honest, I was deeply offended when you said that I am not trying to work as a team, as a matter of fact I really am! In order to prove this, I will sacrifice one for the team and allow you to do the opening speech as a sign of respect! I trust in your words saying that you have enough experience to take over this part although you have way less experience than me or anyone else in this team, but I trust you regardless and I hope this will help you a lot in the future! Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris     I do not mind to share the opening speech and award speech with each other, but I want to deliver you a message here that I do respect your valid arguments and opinions as a member of my team and I do trust you as well.   You mentioned about ISA previous failures, I would like to clarify on this. ISA failed for way deeper reasons and it was not merely due to the ISA event. The ISA community managed to host 39 successful events and I as a volunteer participated most of them so far (starting from very bottom to the top). ISA managed expand their connections to more than 20 countries, we have enough experience regarding hosting events and I can guarantee you the failure was due to many other facts and changing this 40th anniversary will not guarantee us a 100% win.   Have a pleasent day, Regards, Chris
Hello Chris, I received your offer and reflected it intensively. I still think it is still necessary to make some alteration in order to find a way for a successful cooperation. But at the same time, I am also optimistic that we find a good solution for both of us.  Your last offer was a kind of small improvement, because you have also shown that you are willing to cooperate and make concessions. Because of that I hope to bring this negotiation to a presentable result for both of us. I understand your concerns regarding the selection of the music act. But letï¿½s see the facts again here. I agree with you, that our main target is to please the Russians. But letï¿½s pick up the marketing aspect, you have mentioned regarding the music act. As we want to establish connections in Russia, it is essential to create a suitable atmosphere at the conference for the Russian students. The ISA has a long tradition of using the opening of a new office to scout for new talents. And exactly these talents are really open minded and interested in international music acts. Chris, over the last years, I and lots of my colleagues noticed an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts at the ISA events. Therefore, I still think DJ Happy would be the best choice. It is a unique possibility to obligate one of the most famous actors of the world. But as you also made some concessions in your last offer, I am willing to make a compromise and offer you a trade-off in form of the third alternative: the pop band FreeLife. But still rethink my proposal of DJ Happy. Music Act: FreeLife   Regarding the catering, I am still of the opinion that an international buffet would fit perfectly to the core concept of our event. Letï¿½s have a look at the main target of the catering. The conference should have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances which requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. The advantage of a buffet is, that, on the one hand, the formal and business climate is given, as well as, on the other hand, a setting which supports the starting of conversations immensely. Having a very formal three course meal, where everybody sits down for several hours with the same people goes completely against that idea. Furthermore the businessmen can start more easy conversations and find contacts. This would support the starting of cooperation with ISA, which obtains the businessmen values in terms of talented employees, new ideas and a place for the creation of international contacts. Therefore, I am still of the opinion, that the international buffet is the most suitable solution. But since I am definitely willing to collaborate with you, I am offering you a compromise. If you accept my proposal for the catering, I would be willing to make a big concession regarding the sponsor selection. If you comply my catering proposal I am willing to accept Boomerang as our sponsor of the event. Although I am thinking, that Art Inc. would be still the better choice and you forgot some key advantages for Art Inc. like the supporting of long-term relationships of the ISA for example.   Catering: International buffet   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Think well about my proposal and the concessions I made. It was not easy for me to differ from my initial point of view. But I was pleasantly surprised about some aspects of your last offer, especially the presentation task. Therefore I am able to approach you a huge step more. I am offering you the concessions in the music act and the more important sponsor selection.   Date of Conference: Week 3   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  I am looking forward to your answer. With kind regards, Alex
Greetings again,   Alex, your point about the marketing aspect is correct, however not complete. Again some points are missing which I would like to mention. First about the International buffet, I do see the point you are trying to make but the problem is that you are viewing the ISA event from a quite different angel. You mentioned that a three course meal is too formal for this event which I highly disagree. I would like to remind you that the participants are from various different social classes but majority of them are from the higher upper level which I am sure they really do not appreciate seeing a buffet. However, I do agree that there could be changes into ISA and I am quite flexible about that, hence I will agree on your proposal Catering: International buffet   under two conditions. Firstly, you have to agree that this ï¿½international buffetï¿½ will be combined with a performance of our Music Act: Local Russian band  . I did some investigations into this matter, they are a small enthusiastic local band which have performed numerous times in different events. I contacted them and they agreed on going a bit easier with ï¿½tradition songsï¿½ and they will attempt to please all the audience. I personally believe that we should not look at this matter from a black & white perspective, currently we are looking at this matter as there is only two options available: International and modern Versus Traditional Russian. We both had some valid arguments about each point of view hence I believe we shall try to have a mixture of both in one event. This is something new, neat and extraordinary which is exactly what we need for our 40th anniversary. So in summary, Letï¿½s have an international buffet accompanying a Russian Local band which agreed to play a mixed type of songs, I am sure everybody in the audience will be pleased by this.   The second condition is that you agree on my first proposal regarding the presentation. I think this is quite fair since now you had your impact into the planning process of the event which be reported to the ISA headquarters, they will be informed about your contributions and consider you as a valuable volunteer in the future. This is a huge step for a person who started in ISA, even I was not that blessed, hence in return I would like to ask that you agree on me doing the opening speech. You still are able to do the award announcement which will also be a benefit for your career.  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Regards,   Chris
Dear Chris, I approve your concession on the catering very much. Nevertheless I canï¿½t agree the terms attached by you. I cannot completely accept these conditions that you proposed in your counter offer. Please be aware of the follwing facts: Date of Conference: Week 3   Regarding the presentation tasks, I must confess that I was very disappointed that our agreement was revised again. I was so glad and looked forward to get prepared for my opening speech. Now, that you claimed again the opening speech for yourself, I am kind of irritated. How can the opening speech be that important for you, when you have provided to give this task to me last time? The opening speech is the greatest honor of the evening, Chris. You would be at the centre of attention. What would be about the proposal again, to share both tasks between both of us? This would be the fairest distribution of the tasks and both of us would benefit? But firstly stick to the next point. If you are not willing to make some concessions and renegotiate again several tasks while breaking our previous arrangements, maybe we also have to discuss the sponsor selection again? Although, I only was willing to accept your proposal of Boomerang, I am still of the opinion, that Art Inc. would be the best solution. But I will maintain my position for now and give Boomerang a chance...if you give me a sign of cooperation and team work. I am respecting our previous deals for the time being! I have shown my team spirit several times and request you now to do the same here. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Letï¿½s have a look at the facts: Whereas you have prevailed your opinion in the sponsor selection as well as in the presentation task, I only could work out my ideas concerning the catering. I am still not satisfied with the sponsor and speech aspects, but I also see that in a team work task, some trade-offs have to be made. I am not expecting from you, that you accept my proposal of DJ Happy as the music act, but as I am willing to make one LAST concession, I am offering another compromise in the music act. Letï¿½s complete our organization process and take FreeLife as our music act. Although DJ Happy would be the more famous and attractive act, FreeLife would be able to play both, modern pop songs as well as some Russian classics. As you have talked to your local Russian band, I made also some further investigations concerning the music act. In several surveys among our Russian target group, your local Russian band already isnï¿½t the favoured one. The more famous and international music acts are located in front. FreeLife would play an acceptable mixture between our two different ideas of the music act. On the one hand Russian classics, as well as more formal pop songs. This would fit also quite good. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Music Act: FreeLife   Catering: International buffet   Please regard this as an overall offer. I really want carry our team straight forward and therefore accepted always your opinion. I think that with this one small modification in your last offer we can even win the competition as a team. Otherwise we maybe have to renegotiate the sponsor selection and the presentation task againï¿½ I hope now to bring this negotiation to a presentable result for both of us. Unfortunately, Chris, I canï¿½t make more concessions. I made now in three of four aspects an huge step towards you, whereas you prevailed your opinion in two organisational aspects of four. Letï¿½s make a compromise in the last aspect and bring it to a termination. We can! We can win the competition and place the main focus of the competition on our organisational results - I am convinced of it. I am looking forward to get positive response of you. Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, As I mentioned, I am a flexible person who is going to agree on facts and fair arguments. In our case we started off with a lot of disagreements and diverse opinions, at the beginning it might be frustrating for both parties to negotiate about these opinions but eventually we are both trying to organize a good event. Without furthermore hesitation I am straight going to the facts. Regarding the presentation, I am sincerely sorry to hear about the fact that you already prepared for it, but bear in mind we were in a phase which we did not finalize anything, nevertheless I do apologize for any inconvenience caused. The reason of the change was simply due to the fact that you have the opportunity to shine with managing the event since now there are changes which you made and will be reported to the top managers. Since I already organized a lot of events it will not really affect anything unless I do the opening speech. Anyhow, I hope you understand the reason why I was insisting on this and I do appreciate your willingness to give me this golden opportunity. Because of this, I am willing to have a change in our 40th anniversary ISA event.   Alex, it was indeed nice to discuss with you throughout these days, I hope you understand that I never had a bad intention and I was trying to gain the best for both of us and the event. I am hoping to see you soon for organizing everything.   Regards,   Payam
Dear Chris,   Firstly, I want to present myself, Iï¿½m Alex, Iï¿½m student in the University of Stuttgart and part of the ISA since 2009. Honestly, I am really exited about this project: Organizing this event is a real honor for me.   Also, When I heard the team announcement I was glad to be in the same team as you because you seem to be a serious and motivated person.   Iï¿½m sure we will succeed this project because we both know that only with cooperation and compromise our project will be picked up by ISA, and could be a door opener for our future career in some worldwide companies.  Well, here as follow, my first offer  Kind regards,
Dear Alex,  thanks for your first offer and sorry for the late answer. As you know, my name is Chris. Iï¿½m a member of ISA since 2010. Iï¿½ve started there as an intern of the business partners of ISA and Iï¿½m still in contact with most of them.   Iï¿½ve already heard about a lot of the smaller, but really successful events you planned and Iï¿½m really excited to do this event with you! It could really improve our career opportunities.  In my oppinion, within our event we should focus on Russia and the Russian culture to convince at lot of companies of ISA. Therefore, I would prefer to have local Russian cuisine as well as an local Russian band. Moreover, I would prefer to do the speach by myself, because I think my previous work with business partners tought me a lot about business contacts in general and their needs. I also would not prefer week 3 as a date for the conference, but if it fits for you, I will make it possible from my side. The same applies to the sponsores - Art Inc. is quite good, but I would prefer Boomerang because of the offered long term contract.  I hope you understand my point of view. Looking forward hearing from you!  Best regards,  Chris      
Dear Chris,   Thank you for the complete answer. In my opinion we have to focus on the core concept of ISA. ISA is an International Organization, and a lot of people around the world will come to assist at this party. The risk here, is to make this birthday party too Russian and skip the idea that ISA is International. I organized a lot of international party, and every time we needed to mixed the style in order to to please everyone.   So I propose you the following:   In order to please everyone, it is for me THE PRIORITY, to provide an international buffet. Catering is important, and thinking to needs of everyone is important.   For the music, we can talk about a comprise between international music (with DJ Happy) and Russian Music, and then hire the Pop band FreeLife.   If you accept the international catering I may accept your proposal about the Presentation task.   I hope you understand my point of view. Our main objective must remain the organization of an ISA international birthday for international people. Looking forward hearing from you!      Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, I totally understand your point of view, but unfortunately I canï¿½t accept your current offer. I agree to our point regarding the internationality of the event. Therefore, I could accept international food. To employ FreeLife as the music act seems to be a good compromise as well. In order to please not only students, who will be fine with good music and an international buffet, but more our potential business partners I would propose to choose Boomerang as a sponsor, because long-term financial support will be really important and attractive for them. In return, I would even agree to let you prepare the opening speech.  I think this combination will please us and all our guest and I hope you also agree with that. Best regards Chris
Dear Chris, I think the offer you made is a well compromise. On this base i m sure we have all the key to Organize a successfull anniversary. Best regards, Alex
  Dear Chris   Before starting our ISA cooperation I would like to shortly introduce myself.   I`m Alex your partner for the ISA challenge. I joined ISA as a student member in 2009. During this period I got the chance of successfully organizing smaller events. Therefore Iï¿½m glad to have the opportunity to plan the anniversary of ISA with you. I hope for good cooperation and great team performance to win the challenge.   As a first step I think we should discuss the most important issues for planning the event. In my opinion the following issues have to be discussed:   Music act   Catering   Date of the conference   Presentation tasks   Sponsor selection   Enclosed you will find my proposal for the issues. What do you think? Do you agree?   I look forward to hearing from you soon.   Best regards   Alex  
Dear Alex,  sorry for the late answer!  Let me start by introducing myself as well:  My name is Chris. I started at ISA in 2010 after an internship at one of the business partners of ISA, which Iï¿½m still in contact with.  Iï¿½ve already heard about your successful work and Iï¿½m excited about planning the upcoming event with you. Winning this would be a great chance for our future career! In my opinion, within our event we should focus on Russia and the Russian culture to convince at lot of companies of ISA. Therefore, I would prefer to have local Russian cuisine as well as a local Russian band. In return, itï¿½s ok for me to give away the awards and let you do the presentation. Even if I think Boomerang would be the better sponsor (they would sign a long-term contract) I would also make concessions and take Art Inc. as the sponsor. If it fits better to your schedule, I will also agree to the third week for the conference.  I hope you agree to my planning. Looking forward hearing from you!  Best regards,    Chris
  Dear Chris,   Nice to hear from you.     I am glad to see that we came to an agreement for the date, presentation task and the sponsor. For the remaining issues Catering and Music Art my opinion unfortunately differs from yours. Of course I can follow your thoughts about the importance of new companies of ISA, however I think collaboration with local business people and officials, should not have such a big impact on the event concept. In the end, ISA is an international student organisation, which means that first and foremost, it should cater to its client base. If we can get students interested in ISA, our business partners will automatically work with the ISA to get easier access. Therefore I think we should create an atmosphere which support those thoughts. DJ Happy, a very famous performer would be perfect for this event. This DJ regularly fills huge venues with his events and I am sure that his presence will attract many guests, which could then in turn be interested in the ISA for example.   Furthermore I think many of the guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, so it would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. Me for example do not like Russian food and I am sure there will be a lot of other people who do not like Russian food either. In this case it would be really difficult for those people to find anything nice to eat. We should not take the risk. What do you think?       Best regards   Alex  
Dear Alex, well, maybe you are right with regard to arouse interest around students, but I think our focus should be on business partners who are willing to finance us. Even if a lot of students will like the event, it is important to convince the business partner of ISA. Therefore, in my opinion the event should rather be formal and official and we should not invite DJ Happy. Moreover, his performance at the event could shift the focus of the event itself to his performance. This wouldnï¿½t be beneficial at all. If youï¿½d like to have DJ Happy at the event to be attractive for students, I would like to convince new business partners by delivering the opening speech by myself. Furthermore, business partners are always interested in financials. Therefore I would recommend Boomerang as a sponsor for the event just like as a long-term sponsor to be well-positioned.  Moreover, I totally disagree with you about food. The Russian cuisine is really diversified ï¿½ and I doubt you donï¿½t like potatoes and vegetables.  Thatï¿½s why I would still prefer to serve Russian food at our event. So, I think this combination will make our event suitable for students as well as for business partners. What is your opinion about this planning? Best regards   Chris
  Dear Chris,   Thank you for your explanation.   Unfortunately we have  a different point of view about the whole character of the event. In my opinion, the good relationship with Art Inc. should be considered for our decision. They have supported the ISA for a long time and therefore I am really sure that their support will continue in the future unless they change their mind if we are Selecting Boomerang ï¿½ a direct competitor of Art Inc.   Furthermore I have to note that the Russian cuisine is not that diversified you mentioned. Meat is mostly dominating, especially pork. Think about all the Vegetarians, Vegans and our Muslim friends. International food is most suitable to fulfill the needs of everyone. International food also includes Russian food by the way.   For a fair and good solution we should find a compromise. We both have the same aim to win the challenge together. Therefore I am sure we will find an agreement. The time is running, so enclosed you will find an offer which includes both interests. I am sure we will find an agreement.   I will accept the official and  formal atmosphere while having dinner. Therefore I suggest the international three course meal. A compromise between the official atmosphere and the international food. Furthermore I will accept you doing the speech. In return I think it would be okay to have DJ Happy at the event.   Last decision is about the sponsor. I really canï¿½t accept Boomerang. I hope you will understand this. Art Inc is one of our largest and oldest sponsors. This really have to be considerd. Do you agree with me?       Best regards,   Alex  
Dear Alex, Many thanks for your message. As you said, I think we both have different opinions about the event. Nevertheless we should find a compromise in order to create an amazing event and win this competition. Therefore, I would agree to your argumentation about the sponsor and the food ï¿½ I think an international course menu will fit to everyoneï¿½s needs.   Iï¿½m still not happy about your choice of the music act. DJ Happy is quiet popular and I really like his music, but Iï¿½m afraid he could steal the show from our event and attract more attention by himself than our event. Moreover, I think we miss out to include the Russian culture, which is in my opinion a really important factor for the event. To prevent this, we should employ a local Russian band. In return I would accept you doing the speech. I hope you can follow my argumentation and agree with it. Looking forward hearing from you J Best regards   Chris
Dear Chris, Having a local band play at such an event, does not fit the character of an international associationï¿½s meeting. I think the music should be international to make sure that everyone can understand the music. Dj Happy would be really perfect. But maybe we can find also a compromise in this case. You said that you are afraid Dj Happy could steal the show from our event and attract to much attention by himself. I understand this point of your argumentation. Therefore I would suggest the band FreeLife. They are not that popular but international and great music artists. I would accept this compromise including doing the speech by myself. Do you agree?   Best regards, Alex            
Dear Alex,  thank you very much for your proposal. I think itï¿½s a quite good plan for our event! Everyone will enjoy to be there and we will find lots of new members and business partners.  Best regards Chris
Hey good morning Chris, how are you? I hope you had a nice weekend. In my opinion we have collaborated great so far and achieved good results. Let's try this week to clarifie the last open issues. In my opinion this is the Catering, the Date of Conference, the Music Art, the Sponsor Selection and last but not least the presentation task. Enclosed you will find an initial proposal as I think about the event. I think we should talk about it. But due to some university obligation, I can not promise to reply promptly. Greetings Alex
Good Afternoon Alex, I am fine and had a nice weekend thank you for asking, and i hope your day is going great?  I saw your proposal and what you choosed in your Sponsor Selection Art Inc but i went with Boomerang which i know made a very good offer but less money for the event. Boomerang is willing to sign a long term contract and sponsoring future events of ISA and that will provide security for the upcoming events of ISA. The Presentation task, i would like to make a speech on behalf of ISA, i have gained more experience from my student inernship working with one of the partners of ISA and i have coperated the business contracts of ISA in order to help organise the internship for other students on a voluntary basis and therefore i have gained profound knowelege of these business contracts and their interest. I dont think you have tackle a project this big, i know i will be best suited for the speech    In terms of Catering we should go with international three course meal becasuse of the formality of the occassion and to show them our appreciation for them coming to the events. Buffet setting can be more times not organised and can create chaos If we go with the local russian band the people will feel appreciated along with the successful adaptation of the local culture, i think is a vital part in creating a good relationship. I agreed with your decision on the date of conference I hope you do take all these points into consideration and accept my offer. Kind Regards, Chris
Good Evening Chris, I'm sorry that I answer so late, but I still had some meetings within the ISA. I read your suggestions with interest. The conference date should therefore not be a problem. I am glad that we were able to agree that quickly. I understand your concern that a buffet could cause chaose, but in my opinion a buffet gives the participants the opportunity to move free around and talk with different people. In contrast in a formal three course meal you have to sit down for several hours with the same people. In my opinion it does not correspond to the spirit of the ISA, which should be about giving young people the opportunity to come into contact with different companies. Same for the music act. Over the last years, I notices an increasing dissatisfation of the guestes with the music acts at the different events. Therefore I think a famous international act would be exactly the right thing for such an atmosphere where you can move freely around. However, I also recognize that a star like DJ Happy would cost a lot of money. To save costs and budget, I would therefore propose the band FreeLife. I agree with you that you have gathered through your work for the ISA a lot of experience. However, we should bear in mind that we are celebrating the 40th anniversaryof the ISA and we also want to make new contacts in Russia with the event. In my opinion, it would therefore be useful to hire a external speaker. I now that would mean less publicity for the both of us, but having some important talking about the importance of the ISA for the business world would defnitely be worth it. It is the same for the Sponsor Selection. The Art Inc. have supportet the ISA for a long time. I know that Boomerang is willing to sign a long term contract and sponsoring future events of ISA and that will provide security for the upcoming events of ISA. But in my opintion the good relationship with Art Inc. should be sonsidered. As I said before, Art Inc. have supported the ISA for a long time and I think their support will continue unless we give them a reason to change their mind. As you know Boomerang is a direct competitor of Art Inc. ... I look forward to your reply. Best regards, Alex
Hello Alex, I am willingly to make a comprise and has taken your opinion into considering, concerning the International Buffet, the socialization of the guest greatly matters and the opportunity for them to move freely and talk together with different people helps ISA get more business partners. You said you noticed an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts at various events. Letï¿½s keep in mind that the successes of ISA has always been mostly due to the successfully adoption of local culture. I know that this plays a vital part of creating a good relationship with our future business partners in Russian in particularly. The atmosphere of the event should reflect some local culture aspects, while been a very enjoyable conference for all visitors. They are well known Local Band  that resonates with the Russian people, we select the best one that people love and they will put on a good show, without taking away from the real reason why the events is taking place. The Presentation Tasks is all about celebrating the 40th anniversary of the ISA and also making new contacts. Inviting an external speaker makes no sense at all, he has no in depth experience about what even goes on in the ISA network or any experience within the organization. Russian people are tough people to please, based on the fact that an earlier attempt to establish an office in Moscow 2004 failed. So an external speaker that has no knowledge of what goes on in the ISA will not make impact on the events. I understand the publicity part, but this not about publicity this all about the interest of the ISA, without people supporting ISA in Russian it will not be possible. Speaking from the heart greatly matters using an experience individual that knows the in-depth of the system and create real scenarios will be greatly appreciated and help them see our honest motive towards the Organization. Boomerang offered just slightly less money compared to Art Inc. Boomerang is willing to sign long-term contracts for future events of the ISA and that is a binding contracts that will ensure that they will definitely keep to their promise, and they will offer more money next time in any ISA upcoming events. A good relationship of Art Inc. has no guarantee that they will not change their minds from sponsoring upcoming events, after all no binding agreements, all they gave us is just promises of keeping to their words, while we can sue Boomerang if they fail to sponsor the upcoming future events. I hope you will take my recommendation into consideration has I have taken yours into consideration. So we could finish these negotiation as soon as possible. I look forward receiving more positive conclusion Kind Regards, Chris      
Hello Chris, I think we have already achieved very good results until now. You are right about the music act. The atmosphere of the event should reflect some local culture aspects, while been a very enjoyable conference for all visitors. Therefore I agree with you to book some local Russian band for the event. I think the mix of russian music and an international buffet fits together very well. In my opinion there are only two open task left we have to discuss: The presentation task and the selection of the sponsor. After I 've been thinking about your arguments for Bommerang, I'm still of the opinion that we should choose Art. Inc. as a sponsor. As you said, this time it is all about celebrating the 40th anniversary of the ISA. With Art Inc. as a sponsor, we can show our future business partners, with which continuity we work with the individual companies. We should not risk our good cooperation with Art Inc. in such an important event. As a compromise I could offer that you are going to hold the opening speech. As you said, speaking from the heart greatly matters using an experience individual that knows the in-depth of the system and create real scenarios will be greatly appreciated and help them see our honest motive towards the Organization. I think you are more than suitable for this task. I'm looking forward to your respond Best regards, Alex
Hello Alex,   I appreciate the compromise, youï¿½ve made so far. If we go with Art Inc. our financial security of ISA will be affected in a long run. I still donï¿½t see how Art Inc. is a better choice, I know itï¿½s all about the 40th anniversary of the ISA event and showing the longevity and Success of the business model to potential new business partners. But we have to keep in mind that we need business partners like boomerang in terms of written contracts to always support the organisation in a long run. I want to make sure that the financial perspective of ISA is safe for the upcoming years and Boomerang will be the better choice in term of a written contract regarding the future, Art Inc can always decide to change their intentions, even if we have a good relationship with them no guarantees with them. Hope to hear from you soon Regards, Chris    
Hello Chris, due to some time conflicts and our deadline today I am going to accept your offer. The future will show whether Boomerang or Art Inc. would have been the better choice. Best regards, Alex
  Hi Chris,   nice to have you as a partner in this competition. I hope that we will have fun and will successfully plan the annual conference of ISA. Here I give you my first suggestions to some issues regarding the organisation of this event. I would like to give the speach on the opening ceremony because I am a good speaker and consider this an important talent for this task. What do you think?I am looking forward to our joint work! Kind Regards Alex    
Hello Alex, I am looking forward to negotiate with you in the following days.  Regarding you openning offer, I agree that the Date of Conference should be in Week 3 as it is the best possible time to hold the event, as well as I agree that you should hold the opening speech if you feel so confortamble doing it. There is one category with which I do not agree and that is your choice of catering service, reason for that is I believe that local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. Further on, for Music Act, even though I am aware that DJ Happy or FreeLife would be attractive for younger generations, I think the strategy of the event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with local companies and officials, therefore I would like to invite Local Russian Band to perform at ISA event.   Best Regards, Chris 
Dear Chris, thank you for your quick replay and support for selecting the date of conference! I agree that showing respect and appreciation to the Russian culture will strengthen the relationship to local companies and their willingness to cooperate with ISA. But we should not forget that the ISA conference is a very big international event and we are expecting very powerful and important guests from all over the world. We also have to meet their expectations and taste. I consider the choice of location for ISAï¿½s 40th anniversary, namely Saint Petersburg, as a very nice gesture and sign of appreciation to our Russian partners. That is why, I unfortunately donï¿½t support your decision to invite a local Russian band to the conference. Furthermore, I consider international food as the best choice for this event because there will be guests and members from lots of different countries. In order to respect different cultures and their food traditions and habits as well as religious restrictions (pork, lamb) I find this is the best choice.  And, of course, international buffet doesnï¿½t exclude Russian dishes. I would like to discuss the point of sponsor selection with you. I consider Art Inc. the best sponsor for the conference as this company offers ISA the highest investment. Iï¿½d like to hear your point of view on my argumentation. Kind Regards Alex
Dear Alex, as you wanted to held the opening speech, which is not in my best interest, I agreed with you so you could let me decide on some other aspects of this event, therefore I request that our sponsor is Boomerang as the smaller amount of money spent by sponsor Boomerang is balanced by the offer of a long-term contract which would ensure some financial security. Also, I am willing to accept your offer of international buffet as our catering, only if you accept Boomerang as our sponsor.   Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I really appreciated you are concerned in the choice of sponsor and I agree that Boomerang also made ISA a very good offer. I consider the long-term contract very beneficial for future projects, but for such big event of profound importance we will need the highest investment we can get, even if short-term payment. I am willing to make a compromise and accept Boomerang to be our main sponsor, if you are going to accept the International buffet and also DJ Happy as music act. I think this is the fairest way to balance these points. Therefore I accept your offer. Thank you a lot for your effort! I think we managed to find the best solution for both sides. Kind Regards Alex
Dear Chris,       related to the conference of ISA next year we have talked about some issues. But there are also issues which are not determined right now.       So here are my offers for the five issues we have to discuss: Catering: International buffet  Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.         Especially the issue Sponsor Selection is an important one. I know that we had a good relationship with Art Inc. in the last years. They made us the best offer for the conference and we know that they will make us an offer for our upcoming events too. So I think we have to hold this connection with Art Inc.     I hope we can find the best solution for ISA and the upcoming conference.     With best regards,   Alex  
Dear Alex, I have seen your first offer but there are some points I want to discuss. I could accept your preferences with Music Act: DJ Happy  and Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  but instead of this I would like to have the Catering: local Russian cuisine  because I think all the guests would appreciate the tipycal Russian fod as well as the music, but due to the fact that it will be a conference I think it is more important than the music. I would like to hear your point of view on my argumentation, Kind regards Chris
Dear Chris, thank you for your answer. I'm glad that we were able to agree on some issues. So do I assume rightly that you also accept my offer for the Date of Conference and the Presentation Tasks? Catering: I'm convinced that the most of our guests are unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine. Also, this is a multi-cultural event where I couldn't imagine only to offer Russian food. Furthermore, I see the possibility to be free to move around and have a nice talk with different guests while getting the food at the buffet. I think to offer international food is a compromise because so we can be sure that every guest is able to find food he or she likes. International food means that we can serve Russian food as well so that everyone can taste it. But if some of them didn't like it they can always take other food from the buffet. So that means at the moment in my opinion we should take the International buffet. I hope you can follow my thoughts and I'm looking forward to your point of view.   With best regards, Alex  
Dear Alex, Related to: Date of Conference: Week 3 Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris    Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   We arrive a good attitude and could have both parts happy with these, but due to the fact I accept some points of your proposal I hope we can talk about the other two points and you will try to be in my situation that at the end I am letting you to make the first speech and I have grated this sponsor without any discussion.     I understand your point of view with the cuisine but I will propose you have the option of:Catering: International three course meal   You are right, you need to achieve a good deal in the conference with all the guests but in my opinion the buffet an informal way to get meal. Keep in mind that all of our guests will be the most representative parts from their company so if want to make sure they will have a good experience with the food and we refuse the possibility of thee Russian cuisine, I will definitely recommend this option. In addition to this, we conclude that the topic of the food is so complicated to adjust the Russian cuisine to our guests, but at least you should decide to choose local Russian band. Music Act: Local Russian band I think the strategy of the event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with companies and officials and will have a good impression and will get familiar with the country if we try to make tipycal Russian things as the music. I am eagerly waiting your answer. With best regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, I have to apologize because I misunderstood your last Email.   I agree your compromise for the Catering: Catering: International three course meal In my opinion this compromise will be the best choice for our guests.   About the issue Music act I think we have to talk again. Like I know the guests from ISA events were dissappointed with the music act in the last years. So my first thought was to bring an famous musician to our conference. I don't think that we should concentrate only on Russia because this is primarily the anniversary from ISA the multinational organisation which has to take it's focus on young students. So in my opinion a local Russian band would not fit in our contept to reach young new students.   Thank you for your great cooperation. I'm looking forward to your answer.   Best regards, Alex  
"Dear Alex, I apologise for my last email, I did not put into words the  idea I have in mind. I feel very strong with the idea of Music Act: Local Russian band ; I think the strategy of the event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with local companuies and officials. DJ Happy would attract younger geenration but this is not the goal of the conference.We have to keep in mind that the music is not the main attractive of the event and we do not want to distract the attention from the event towards the music act and there is no guarantee that his reputation would not overshadow the reputation of the ISA. Well, in spite of Russia is not the role of the event, letting our guests to know something more about the culture of the country we are doing the conference will be a good point in favour of the organisation. What I want to express in my previous email is that I have concerned you some points as the sponsor, the date and the presentation tasks, in favour of your point of view. We talk about which would be the best solution for the catering and my opinion of how we have to act in front of the music is unchangeable. With this last point, we can conclude with the conference which would be positive for both parts. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best regards, Chris"
Dear Chris, no problem. Unfortunately I have to disagree again with the Music Act. Like I told you I heard that the young students werenï¿½t happy with the Music Act in the last years. Yes the music should not be the main act at our conference but if the young student will leave our conference earlier instead of sitting and talking with others because they donï¿½t like the music we should think about an alternative. There is the opinion to take the Pop Band Free Life. They are not as famous as DJ Happy but I think they can entertain all of our guests with a mix of new and older songs. I'm looking forward to your point of view.   With best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, I could not accept this offer unless you renegotiate the other parts. I could accept as a final offer the previous one I made, with the Local Russin band as the music act during the conference either being the local Russian cuisine who takes care about the catering or either I will the responsible for the speech and boomerang will be the sponsor. At first, I did not make any discuss about the other topics and letting it as the initial offer which means I am conceding you some good points in the negotiation, hoping that you will be taking this into account in the further topics but this is not as I expected. One possible final offer will be one of the three I propose before. I know that with this one of these three we are going to arrive to a good position at the negotiation. I am willing to continue negotiating on ISA conference. I am eargely awaiting your answer. Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I can not accept your last offer. Unfortunately I had a problem understanding your first offer. But after a few Emails I could find out which issues are important for you. I think it is important to come to an agreement for the ISA conference now. I could arrange myself with your offer numer one and the following Prefereces: Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.    I hope this is ok for you and we can start to plan our event next year.   Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, The important thing is that at the end we arrive at an agreement with the ISA conference and we could start working as soon as possible with the planning of the event next year. I am pleased with the negotiation we have already made. I wish you have a good day.  Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I took the time to think about our remaining open points that we still haven't agreed upon. You can find my preferences enclosed. I would say, we organize an international buffet. This would allow a sociable atmospher and networking opportunities, which is very important for all our guests. Concerning the date, I would suggest, that we choose the third week, since as far as I know, it is the only one that does not clash with another event. I would further say, we pick Art Inc. for sponsoring. We have a good relationship which, in my opinion, we should maintain. They have supported us for a long time, and I'm sure, they will do so in the future. As you know, two of the presentations will be held by the organizers. I thought that we split the two presentations between us. What do you think? And last but not least, the Music Act. I would prefer DJ Happy, since he is very famous and will definitely attract many guests. Looking forward to your feedback. Best, Alex
Hi Alex, Your points concerning the date and division of tasks are valid, and I agree on those. The third week sounds like the only reasonable date. The presentation tasks should be divided, and I would even be willing to give you the honour of opening speech, but in exchange I would like for you to be more flexible in some accounts. Most importantly, I strongly disagree on choices on catering and music act. The event is supposed to honor our Russian members and guests. Most of all, a certain level of formality and prestige should be kept and a buffet really does not offer that. The sponsor selection should also be discussed further, as I really feel that the long-term contract Boomerang is offering, suits our future needs really well. Sincerely, Chris
Hi Chris, thank you for your reply. I am happy to see that we were able to agree on the date and splitting the presentation task. If you think, a buffet is not suitable and a three course meal is better, maybe we can have an international three course meal? I know, the opening will be i Russia, but I still think we should consider that we are an international organization. I would say an international meal fits better to our organization. And we should not forget, that we not just invite Russians. If we choose an international three course meal, we might better meet the taste of guests. What do you say? Concerning the local Russian band, I am not sure if this would fit the character of an international association. If you don't agree with DJ Happy, maybe we hire the pop band FreeLife? I understand your point, when you are saying you want to select Boomerang, since they are offering a long-term contract. However, we have a good relationship to Art Inc. and they have supported us for a long time already. I fear that by selecting Boomerang for sponsoring, this might change, since Boomerang is a direct competitor of Art Inc. What do you think? Looking forward to your comments. Best, Alex    
Hi again, I'm sorry but these terms are not possible for me to agree. I feel like I already gave you the decision on the date of conference and was even willing to allow you to hold the speech. Unless you are willing to re-negotiate those terms, I feel like I need something in exchange. How would you feel if we even chose Art inc. as the main sponsor, but still added the Russian flavor by choosing a Russian band and the cuisine? This would already grant you three of you opening wishes. The other option would be to hire the FreeLife as the band, but then I would have to ask you to agree with me on the sposor to be Boomerang, as I feel it would better suit the long-term need of the organization. Br, Chris
Hi Chris, I'm sorry to have upset you. That wasn't my intention. If you really think, that having Boomerang as our sponsor is the best option and will not harm our relationship to Art Inc., than I would suggest we take Boomerang as our sponsor.  However, I really don't feel that a Russian band would fit to our organisation. So instead I would like to pick FreeLife for our Music Act, as you suggested. Then the catering is our remaining open point. As I mentioned in my last message, I don't think all of our guests will like Russian cuisine. We will not just have guests coming from Russia. I know, that we are celebrating the opening of our newly established subsidiary Saint Petersburg. But we are also celebrating the 40th anniversary of ISA, which is an international organisation. I would say we concentrate the international aspect. What do you say? Best, Alex  In my opinion, we should stick to an international three course meal.  
Hi Alex,   Sorry for the short reply, I'm kind of in a hurry. Still, the sponsor selection has been the only one that has really gone according to my wishes. I say we split the remaining issues. The way I see it, we have two options, and you can choose the one more suitable one for you: Either we keep the rest of the offer constant and change the music act to the local russian band. Or we serve the local russian cuisine, and you may choose the band freely. This way we could keep both the local atmosphere and still have an international flavor. What do you think? Br, Chris
Hi Chris, No problem. I am sorry, but I really don't think, that a Russian menu would fit our theme. If you think combining local and international aspects is a good idea, maybe we can have a local russian band for our russian guests. But than I would suggest having the buffet instead.  This would give everybody the chance to network and chat. I am just afraid, that maybe those who don't like Russian music will leave the event. However, if they already found someone to chat, it is more likely that they will stay and are more open towards a new style of music... Best, Alex
Hi again, Are you absolutely certain that the Local Russian cuisine is not an option? As I said, I would be willing to let you decide the music act just the way you like? I'm sorry, but I still feel that the buffet just does not offer the level of formality and prestige that such an amazing event deserves. So how about the international three-course meal? That way the date and presentation tasks are suitable for you interests, Sponsor selection and music act to mine and the catering is a compromise. We could also set the catering to be the international buffet, but then I would have to ask the permission to hold the speech, when you give the awards. That is also fine by me if you prefer that? Best regards, Chris 
Hi Chris, I am really sorry, but the Local Russian cuisine is really not an option for me. I am just too afraid, that some of our guests would not like it. I really prefer the buffet. Thus I like your suggestion to have the international buffet for catering, in return you can have the honor of giving the opening speech and I give the awards. That way catering and date are suitable to mine interest while sponsoring and presentation are to your interest and the Music Act is a compromise. What do you say? Best, Alex
"Hi again Alex, Well, the case here is that the international buffet, using your words, ""really is not an option to me."" So if you absolutely want to get it, it is possible, but then I have to insist that I both get to keep the speech and the chosen music act is according to my preferences. Without these concession I really cannot accept the international buffet, I'm sorry. Best regards, Chris"
Hi again, First of all, I really want this to work. However, I cannot accept your proposal, as I am not convinced, that this is the best way to organise the event. I think we both agree, that week 3 is the only week that is suitable for our event, since it is the only week without any other event taking place. So I don't really understand why you always say, this is only my preference. What would be your preference instead? I am further really convinced, that we should focus on the international aspect. I also think that a buffet is a good way to network, which is important for all of us. Concerning the sponsoring, I actually preferred Art Inc, but if you are convinced Boomerang will not have an effect on our good relationship with Art Inc, I am ok choosing Boomerang instead. You know, I really don't feel a Local Russian band is a good option. My preference would be DJ Happy, but I am ok if we pick FreeLife as a compromise. In your line of argumentation, both of us get two (if week 3 is really just my preference) of our preferences and make one compromise. I think this sounds fair. However if you really think having some Russian flavour in our event is important, I'd say we have a Local Russian band, but only under the condition that we pick the inernational buffet, week 3, I can give the opening speech and we choose Boomerang as a sponsor. Best regards, Alex
"Hi again, You are right in the matter that week 3 would also suit me. However, the ""2 for you, two for me"" -situation for the rest is not quite correct here, as we both know that for example the decision of speaker is only of minor importance, whereas the selection of catering plays a huge role in such an event. Or if it is, would you be willing to give me for example the decision on music act and catering, as you just proposed for you to choose? I think not, but if you are, let's make a deal! :) The situation here is such that we can consider week 3 as chosen. Then the four others should be divided rather equally. So what would be you solution? Here is one, where I agree to take the speech and catering, whereas you get to decide the sponsor and music act. Would this be ok to you? Hopefully we can get into some kind of an agreement, as I really wish to make most of this amazing event! Br, Chris"
Hi Chris, I am glad to hear, that we both want this to be a success. Your suggestion sound like a fair deal. However, I really don't think that local Russian cuisine would be a good option. So how about instead, you get to decide on the sponsor and music act and I on the speech and catering? Best, Alex
Hi, Sounds good enouh for me! (ps. Thanks for the negotiations and have a good Christmas etc. :)) Br, Chris
Hi Chris, I am looking forward to discuss with you within the next days about the upcoming ISA event. Greeting. Alex
Hi Alex, Thank you for your e-mail. I am glad as well to talk with you about the ISA event. With regard to the upcoming event in Russia, I already booked a local Russian catering service and prepayed a local Russian band. Since we aim for a long-term sponsor including future events, I propose Boomerang to be our main sponsor. Furthermore, I have the following suggestions concerning the different organisational topics which we should discuss: Date of Conference: Week 4   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris     I'm looking forward to your feedback.   Best regards, Chris
Hi Chris, thank you for your offer. In both our interests I think we should discuss about all aspects regarding the upcoming ISA event. We are a team and should act like one. So let's talk about which point is important to you? Maybe we find a solution which fits to both of us. For me Catering is a very crucial point. Since many of the guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, I think it would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. So I would prefer to have an International buffet. This aspect seems very important to me. Regarding the Music Act I noticed over the last years an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts at the ISA events. I think that some currently famous international act would be exactly the right thint to attract the kind of dynamic guests the ISA is looking for. That is why I am sure that DJ Happy would fit very well to our upcoming event. The sponsor selection is also a very important point to me. I would like to choose Art Inc. because they have supported us for a long time and I am sure they also will in the future. Your offer concerning the presentation tasks is ok for me. The date of conference in week 4 is not my prefered solution because it is very close to the Christmas holidays and therefore not perfect so I would prefer Week 3 but if it is important to you we can also agree on the 4th week. I am looking forward to hear from you and I am sure that we will find a good solution. Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Thank you for your answer and your input regarding the topics to be discussed. Of course we will work in a team and please feel free to ask about anything that is unclear. I just wanted to support you in advance. I thought about the event as such and think that the whole event can take place under a slogan such as ï¿½Experiencing Russia and its cultureï¿½. Therefore, I think that the orientation of this event should be aligned with the Russian culture and its experience in order for all of us to get familiar with our new country of interest. With regard to the meal, I understand your point of view. However, a buffet with such an amount of people will cause an uncoordinated workflow of the evening. And since there are also higher ranked people attending the event, there should be some kind of professionality and formality which is not given by a buffet. Also, as this event is of high importance for our Russian relationship, we should show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests ï¿½ and those, who are not familiar with the Russian cuisine will get the unique chance to taste it! Therefore, I guess that the local Russian cuisine will fit best this unique and important event. Concerning the music act, I guess that it is crucial that we start to establish relationships with local Russian companies and organisations. Therefore, a local band will support getting into contact with Russian officials. In addition to that, I heard of some negative reputation of the band you proposed. Due to this, I cannot support your choice since I think that our event will suffer hereby. I guess we should find another solution for this. My proposition is still a local Russian band. The selection of an adequate sponsor is also of paramount importance to me. I got some reliable information that Art Inc. is more interested in short-term agreements. Additionally, I got an insider information that Art Inc. will announce bankruptcy in a few months. Since we aim at having a trustworthy and long-lasting relationship with our Russian colleagues, we should consider this in the sponsor selection which still supports my choice of taking Boomerang here to guarantee the financial support of our future events in Russia. With regard of the date of the conference, I think your proposition of week 3 is a good choice since all members do not get into a hurry due to the coming Christmas holidays. I think here we can both be happy with our solution. Concerning the opening, I can offer you to take over the most part of the work and prepare the speech so you only have to prepare the awards ceremony.   I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and I am also sure that we will organise an amazing event together.   Have a nice day Best regards, Chris
Hi Chris, the selection of the sponsor is the most important point to me but I will make a concession and let you choose Boomerang as it is your favorite sponsor. Mine would have been Art Inc. In return you should support me in my choice of catering and music act. I want the event to get an international touch which is very crucial to me.  Hopefully you agree with my suggestion. Regards, Alex
Dear Alex, I am happy to receive your answer. We already agreed on most of the issues which is very great to see. With regard to the music act and the dinner, I see your point but as it already failed once in Russia, we should definitely try to make it an amazing success this time and take into account cultural issues. Therefore, I would suggest that we split it into two parts so that we both can contribute best to the event: we will take your proposition regarding the music act to get an international atmosphere and to also attract younger people. This includes your wish of having an international touch. On the other hand, we will combine it with local Russian cuisine as showing our interest in our Russian colleagues. By doing so, the event will be international and linked to the Russian culture. I guess like this we found a very good combination of our different interest and we will organise an amazing event supporting ISA. Have a great day. Best regards, Chris
"Hey Chris, thank you for your message. Since to me the catering is more important than the music I would prefer to switch your concessions and would propose an international buffet and in return for you the band ""Free Life"" which should fit to both of us. I hope you are fine with that. Regards, Alex"
Dear Alex, Thanks for your input. I guess that having FreeLife as the music act is a very good propositian and does fit both of us. Concerning the internationaal buffet, I still have some doubt that it might not be that professional and formal as some of our participants of higher rank would prefer. Therefore, I have a last suggestian and would like to offer you to switch to the International three course meal. Here, we have a great compromise by having your international orientation while still keeping a formal atmosphere. I'm looking forward to receiving your feedback. Best regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, with Free Life as Music Act I am also ok but either you should make a concession concerning the catering or the sponsor selection. Since sponsor selection is for me the most crucial point and I already made a concession, I would appreciate it if we would agree on an international buffet in return. This should also be my last proposal. Hope that we can agree on that. Best Regards, Alex
Hi Alex,I think we found a very good solution in order to create the ISA event. Thank you for the online negotiation. Best regards, Chris
Hi Chris,   Iï¿½d like to write you because of the remaining points which we have to negotiate concerning the ISA conference. So I tell you my first suggestions with regards to the open issues. First of all I would suggest organising the conference in the third week of our time frame. Concerning the music act I would suggest DJ Happy because he is a famous international act and with him we could attract many guests which could then in turn be interested in the ISA. With respect to the catering, I would say we should have an international buffet where everybody is able to find something they like. Another point we have to negotiate is the presentation. I think an external speaker could be beneficial for the event because having someone important talking about the importance of the ISA for the business world would be great. Last but not least we should choose an appropriate sponsor. In my opinion Art Inc. would be a great choice because they have made us a good offer and the ISA should maintain the good relationship with Art Inc.   Iï¿½m looking forward to your reply. Best regards Alex
Hi Alex, hope you're doing well!! I am really eager to plan the annual conference and 40th anniversary of ISA together with you. I would really like to win this competition so I will try to do my best in proving ISA that I can plan an event like this one together with you. As the name of the ISA says it, I would like to set up un international evening with an easy-going athmosphere for both students and business partners. Therefore, I suggest that our catering should consist of a set of typical russian cuisine dishes. I think it would be the best option due to the location of the event and our participants. Also because I think that a catering with less than 3 main dishes wouldnt accomplish the expectations of such an important people attending to our event. With the same purpose I would like to have a Pop band during the evening. I think that a DJ playing electronic music would be a bit uncomfortable for our guests cause its not the main goal of the evening to have such a party so that's why I think the best idea for us would be the pop band. About the date of the conference I agree with you about the third week as there is some time left until Christmas and the ISA's higher members could attend the meeting. Another important issue are the sponsors. I think we should choose Boomerang cause a partnership with them looks pretty much better regarding to terms of a long duration contract. Probably in Art Inc. they will be a bit disappointed with us but the conditions that Art Inc. can offer us regarding to future events of the ISA are quite better. Finally, I would like to propose myself as the speaker of the event. I think it could sound a bit arrogant but I think I have really strong presentation skills and I trust that I could do it much better than third person.  I think that's pretty much everything I wanted to explain you. I'm looking forward to your repply. Regards, Chris.
Hi Chris,   thanks for your response. Iï¿½m happy that we made our first decision by agreeing to organize the conference in the third week. Furthermore I agree with you that our goal is to win the competition so I would like to negotiate with you the following points to ensure that this conference will be a success. I agree with you that the conference should have a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. In my opinion a buffet fits this goal best because with a buffet you have the possibility to move around. I see your point that a Russian cuisine would fit the location. Nevertheless it is a multi-cultural event and I canï¿½t imagine local specialities working for such an event. Additionally I agree with you to invite a pop band for the event and FreeLife would be an appropriate pop band because of their popularity. Another point which you proposed was that you want to give the speech. When your presentations skills are very well then I would accept that you will give the speech. In return I would then have the possibility to announce the winner of the yearly ISA award. But I think we have to talk again about the sponsor. Iï¿½m not sure if Boomerang would really be the right choice. I still think that Art Inc. would be the best option because they have supported ISA for a long time and Iï¿½m sure that their support will continue in the future. Choosing Boomerang could be a reason for them to cancel the collaboration because Boomerang is a direct competitor of Art Inc.   I hope we find a good solution for the remaining points so that the conference will be successful.   Iï¿½m looking forward to your reply. Best regards Alex
Hi Alex, Im also happy that we finally agreed with some aspects.  About the catering I still think that the best idea would be to have the local Russian cuisine. I think that people attending to an event like this conference are expecting something with more category than a buffet. Thats why I think this kind of catering doesnt fit with our conference. I suggest it cause its also a way to bring closer the Russian habits and costums to the participants. Regarding to that, I think that a it would be really interesting if the music act would be a Local Russian band, I know it's not what I said before but after thinking about it I realized that the Local russian band woud also contribute to create this easy-going athmosphere and to get closer to the Russian culture. About the date of the conference and the presentation tasks, Im really glad that we reached an agreement. Now let's tallk about the sponsor. I know that is really hard to reach an agreement here but I still think that Boomerang is our best choice. I still dont trust the conditions of the contract we have with Art Inc. cause they dont guarantee any sponsorship for the future events and that's what worrie me the most. There are some risks to be taken with the sponsor and I cannot see other better option than Boomerang. I think there won't be any problem with Art Inc. in fact I think that chosing Boomerang could benefit the ISA because maybe it will make Art Inc. to reconsider the conditions they offer us when they made their sponsorship purpose for this event and it could be benefitial for further events. I'm waiting for your response and I hope we can reach an agreement soon. Have a nice day, Chris.
Hi Chris,   Iï¿½m also glad that we already decided on the date of the conference and the presentation task.   In spite of that I am a little bit unhappy that we have to discuss the music act again. My first choice was DJ Happy but then I accepted your suggestion to invite the pop band FreeLife. So I think we should keep that decision. It was your first proposal and I already changed my mind considering your wish and I donï¿½t want to change it again.   I have taken a close look at your arguments concerning the two remaining points and I want to show you further arguments for the Art Inc. and an international buffet.   Unfortunately I think it could be a problem for some of our guests if we just offer Russian food because not all of the guests may like this. I just want to make sure that the guests get food they like, even if it does not suit the needs of the event perfectly.   Another reason why Art Inc. would be a good choice is that they offer us more money than Boomerang which we need for the conference.   I hope youï¿½ll reconsider your wish concerning the music act and that we both think about the options of the sponsor and the catering. Iï¿½m willing to discuss these two points again so that we find an agreement soon.   Iï¿½m looking forward to your reply. Best wishes Alex
Hi Alex, As I said before the main argument for me to have the local russian cuisine for the catering its because I think that in a serious event like ours you cannot offer a buffet. Its wouldnï¿½t be reasonable for me if I were one of our future partners to go to the conference and have to go every time I want food to a food expositor and serve my own food and then go back to my table. I hope you understand that this is not an informal dinner with some friends, that's the main reason for me to think that a buffet is not suitable at all in our event. We are trying to reach an objective that is reallyl important for our organisation and we have to try to have the best choices to made the ISA more attractive to the russian investors.  Regarding to the musical performance, I properly understand your position. I changed my mind about the kind of music I wanted in the event, I know, but I didnt carefully think about it at the beginning. I think it could be very interesting for most of the participants of the event to listen some russian music, cause we will show our support to the russian music and that will help us especially with the potential investors from Russia. And this aspect goes together with the catering, I think is very important for us to keep our investors happier, cause our main objective is to establish our organisation in Russia so we have to try to seduce them and persuade them to let us open our office there. Finally I would like to talk about the sponsor. I am completely agree with you about everything you said regarding to Art In. and I understand your position. You are right they offer us more money than Boomerang, but they dont assure us any other sponsoring for future events and this is a like a long distance race, we have to look forward as well. The main goal for me would be to chose the best option for the organization and not only for this event, and the only feasible choice I see there is Boomerang.   Nevertheless, I would be willing to change my opinion about the music act if you accept my proposals for the catering and the sponsor as we have to be able to collaborate for the success of the organization.   I wait for your answer. Have a nice evening, Chris.
"Hi Chris, Initally I wanted to have a DJ and I agreed with you to have a the pop band FreeLife and I'm not happy that you'r now that persistant concerning your new idea of having a russian band. But I also have a suggestion for you. I would agree to invite a local russian band when you will accept an international buffet (I wrote my argumentation in the following) moreover I really understand why you want Boomerang as a sponsor and why you think that they would fit best. So I would accept this decision also when we offer an international buffet because I really don't think that the russian cuisine is a good option. I think a buffet would create this relaxed and easy-going atmosphere which we both want to have. The guests would have the possibility to talk and move around while eating. Otherwise they would sit down for several hours with the same people which goes completely against that idea. I see your point that you have concerns if the business partner wouldn't like this. But I think we should not only think about the business people but also about the students. I would like to focus on the core business of ISA, by creating a new conference concept which puts the students in the focus of this event. I agree with you that the business partner are important but in my opinion if we can get students ï¿½ the future talents ï¿½ interested in the ISA, then the business partners will automatically work with the ISA to get easier access to these talents. Consequently, I think that attracting students implicitly means attracting businesses. In the end, ISA is a student organisation. Besides that we also celebrate our 40th anniversary at that day and I think a russian cuisine does not fit this event. Moreover it is a multi-cultural event and not a russian event where a lot of international guests are invited and I have concerns that they will all like the russian food. With international food we won't exclude russian food but we would also offer additional food so that everyone finds something he likes. I see yout point that we have think about the russian business partners and thats why I would accept a russian band to have this ""russian thing"". I hope you understand my position and I'm looking forward to find an agreement with you. Best regards Alex  "
Hi Alex, Your conditions are totally reasonable for me.  So in the end we will have the internatinal buffet for the catering, the conference will be place in the week 3, the music act will be a Local russian band, I will be the speaker of the event and you will award the candidates and our sponsor will be Boomerang. Im glad that finally we reached an agreement. I wish you all the best, see you soon. Best wishes, Chris.
Dear Mr.Chris,   We need to organize a award ceremony in Russian recently. So here I send my offer to you, please check out wether you are agree with this offer.   Best Regards Alex
Dear Mr Alex, I total agree with you of your choice about the Music Act: Local Russian band . A great idea! I also think that the best option is to share the activities of the Presentation Tasks.   But we need to talk about the other options. I think that Boomerang will be the best choice because of the long-term contract. What is if Art Inc. will change their mind in the future? The catering should be a little bite more fancy. This condition will not fill the international buffet so I think. In the aspect of the 40 th anniversity of ISA.  I think that another week will be better. So here is my back offer. Best regards, Chris  
Dear Mr. Chris, I think your opinion of choosing the Boomerang as Sponsor is reasonable, there is truely the potential problem of  Art Inc, so I agree with your Sponsor Selection: Boomerang ! But I am not quite agree with the selection of catering that you offer me, because the guests come from many different country all over the world, so I think may be we schould choose the international buffet, which completely suitable for our international style of our ceremony.  I also can accept the time of week 4. So here is my new offer. Best regards,   Alex
Okay, I agree with you partly. You are right with the international impact but you know, its the 40th anniversaire of ISA. We have to celebrate it! Thats the reason why I think that we should offer a three course meal. Everything else will be a little bit small and mean.   Best regards, Chris
Dear Mr.Chris, Okay, I agree with your offer, because I think the 40th anniversaire of ISA is also really important, so the international three course meal is the appropriate choice for our ceremony!  I look forward to seeing you at the ceremony! Best regards Alex
  Hello Chris,   Hope you had a nice weekend. Our concept is developing very well. Wouldnï¿½t it be nice to win this competition together? The rewards are really great, arenï¿½t they? I think we did a great job so far. As we have already come to a decision in most of the issues we finally only have to discuss some topics concerning the atmosphere of the celebration. Regarding our previous teamwork I think it wonï¿½t be too difficult to come to a common decision. So here is a first proposal of me. I left two points open, because I think it would only be fair to give you the opportunity to first tell me your opinion about some topics. Let me know what you are thinking of these two issues and my proposal on the whole.   Date of Conference: No Selection   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: No Selection   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Catering: International buffet     Best regards Alex
Greetings Alex, As you said our job is going well. I think that we can come to a common understanding around some issues that we have. I have to be honest with you, clearly we see things diferently and will have to come to an understanding together. Catering: local Russian cuisine  I think is a bad idea because we are not dealing with a regular meeting, it is a formal occasion that is happening in Russia and I strongly reccomend that we make an agreement between the International three course mealor the Local Russian cuisine. Date of Conference: Week 3  Is the week that suits me the most. Tell me your toughts about this date. Music Act: Local Russian band  I am affraid that for the Music Act DJ Happy will overshadow our goal and purpose of the occasion so I am proposing the Local Russian band that will fit well with the culture where the occasion will be. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  I would like if it is not a problem to divide the presentation tasks so that I do the speech and that you present the awards. Let me know if it suits you or not. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   I like it that you choose Art Inc. as our sponsor but maybe we can talk about Boomerang as our sponsor option. If you can give me some toughts of what do you think about Boomerang.   With regards, Chris
Good evening Chris, I really like your honesty. You're right, for some issues we have different positions, but I'm confident that we're able to find a common solution. Finding such a solution might be easier if we would know each other better. Maybe you will tell me something more about you and your reason for participating in this competition.   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  Well, I would definitely prefer to hold this speech by myself,because it is a great opportunity to present yourself in front of such a broad audience. Nevertheless, as a gesture of good will and to show you that I'm interested in working as a team, I'm willing to give you the chance to hold the speech by yourself, whereas I'm going to do the non prestigious presentation of the awards. Date of Conference: Week 3  This is also not my preferred week, but I can live with it. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  Nice to hear that you can imagine to choose Art Inc. as our sponsor. I definitely favor Art Inc. over Boomerang, because they are willing to pay more money for this event. Having more money means having the opportunity of making a greater event and that will of course attract more people, business people as well as students. Catering: International buffet  You're right, the event takes place in Russia, but we are an international organisation, so there is no reason for choosing an local russian cuisine. I rather think that it would be good for the event to offer an international cuisine to show all guests that we are international. This is also attractive for russian business people, because if they join, they join an international organisation. The best solution will be an international buffet. People are not fixed on their seats, but are able to walk around. This facilitates networking. Networking with students as well as with potential business partners. This should be in your interest. Music Act: DJ Happy  According to you, what is the goal and the purpose of this event? We are celebrating our 40th anniversary, too. 40 years are a long time. DJ Happy is very famous. He will be able to attract many people (business people AND students). With his help we ware able obtain a great attention for our event. In addition we should alway have in mind that the basis of our organisation are students, so without students our organisation will die. An international act will be more attractive to students.   With regards, Alex
Good evening Alex, Thank you for being so polite and understanding in some issues that we are talking about. I am participating in this competition just for a sense of accomplishment and acknowledgement.   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  Thank you for giving your toughts about this issue and that you have allowed me to do the speech. Date of Conference: Week 3  If you do not mind then we can arrange the conference on this week. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  Yes you are right Art Inc. is a good choice and we can take them as our sponsor for the event. Catering: local Russian cuisine  I undestand your idea of the international event but don't you think that people can mingle around even after the meal? Because a meal doesn't take up that much of your time and you can go and talk with people after you finish your meal. I think that the local Russian cuisine would be the perfect catering just because it is a international event and we can offer some Russian specialities to people that never maybe had the chance to taste. Music Act: FreeLife  I think that we should establish a good relationship with the people around us and I am affraid that DJ Happy would distract us from our goal because of how famous he is and his popularity.  Take your time and think about it but maybe we can try the band called FreeLife, what are your toughts?   With regards, Chris
  Good morning Chris,   I think we come along with our concept very well, thanks for that!   Oh wow okay, sounds good, so did I get it right that you're not interessted in receiving a job offer? Or did I misunderstood that fact?   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  You're welcome. Date of Conference: Week 3  Yes, would be okay. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. Thanks for choosing Art Inc. I think this is the best choice regarding our event. Catering: International buffet I got your point, but after such a big meal, especially after a three course meal, people might get lazy and therefore are no more interested in talking to many people. In the end the networking will suffer from having a big meal where people are fixed to their seats until they have finished eating. I like the fact that we agree that it is important to have in mind that it's an international event. Therefore I think offering only russian cuisine is not possible, as it is important that everybody will be comfortable at our event. Some guests aren't familiar with the russian cuisine and they won't eat it. On an empty stomach they will never become a member. We should ensure that every guest will be able to find something they like. Furthermore, the international buffet could also include some russian specialities, then people can taste russian food if they want to, but they are not forced to eat it. Chis, I will remind you that I've already made big concessions towards your wishes (presentation, week), whereas you've only made small concessions to me (Sponsoring, but this seemed to be a good alternative for you anyway and a very small step towards me regarding the music). To show me your willingness to work as a team, you really should think about the international buffet. We haven't fixed anything yet, so there is for example still the chance to make the presentation by myself or hire an external person. Music Act: DJ Happy I still haven't unterstood what you mean by our goal. You mean the good relationships or something else? In my opinion DJ Happy will be able to attract some dynamic guests. They will be good for our event and for our organisation as well. However, maybe I'm willing to choose FreeLife as an alternative to DJ Happy. Depends on the concessions you will make in your next proposal regarding other topics.   With regards, Alex
Greetings Alex, As I said I am just doing this event to get recognised for the work I do and how I perform.   Catering: International buffet   You have a good point there and I will accept your offer to have the International buffet. As long as we will have some Russian delicacies wich is important for me because of the local Russian guests that we have. Music Act: DJ Happy   DJ Happy is a very famous and popular DJ and in my opinion that can present a problem for our guests. Maybe people will not socialise that much when they are focused on a popular DJ and his songs. That is my main concern that people would rather listen and enjoy to the music that we provided than focusing on the important things for our event. But if you think that DJ Happy will help our cause I will gladly accept your offer.   With regards, Chris
Hello Chris, oh wow thanks for that great offer. But now I think you've made too many concessions. As I know that our team performance/joint outcome is a very important criteria for winning this competition and because I respect your opinion regarding the Music Act I'm willing to engage the Band FreeLife instead of DJ Happy. (And furthermore I promissed you to do so). So now you only have to accept this proposal and then I think we got it. We finally found our concept. Hope we will win the competition.   Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.      
Greetings Alex, I really appreciate your good will and I am suprised for your change in the offer for the Music Act. Anyhow it was a real pleasure working with you on this event and I hope we will have the chance to work on some other in the future. I am too hoping for us to win in the competition. Best of luck, Chris
Dear Chris,   how are you doing? Are you busy organizing internships for ISA students?   I'm glad that we have been working together in such a collaborative way and I hope we will do it in the same way for the remaining pending points. We complement each other well since you have some experience in cooperating with business contacts and I have got some more experience in planning and organizing such events.   There are still some open issues to discuss though to complete our planning concept for the 40th anniversary in Saint Petersburg, Russia. I'm sure we will find a suitable solution on the remaining issues so that we have the chance to win the competition.   In order to continue our cooperation I would like to detail some of my main negotiation points in the following.   Catering: Catering: International buffet   I would like the conference standing for an open atmosphere that enables networking and new connections for all participants. Therefore it is crucial that the catering represents a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. In my opinion only with an international buffet we can have this kind of atmosphere since walking around freely and talking while eating makes it easy establishing contacts. Furthermore everybody will find this kind of international food that he or she likes.   Sponsor selection: Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   I have checked all proposals accurately and came up with the idea to choose Art Inc. as our sponsor for the event. The reason therefore is the highest payment for the event and that we have a good relationship with this company for many years. Even though it is a short-termed contract Iï¿½m quite sure they will support us in future events and we should not make them angry in choosing a direct competitor like for example Boomerang. Otherwise Art Inc. will probably not support us anymore although they have made great effort in the past for ISA and contributed much to the success of ISA.   Above mentioned are my main points and I would be very pleased if we could do it in that way. Iï¿½m also ready to make concessions in all other points depending on your preferences.   What do you think about week 3 ( Date of Conference: Week 3 )  or alternatively week 4 as the date for the conference? Also which kind of music act would you like for the conference? I would propose an international music act ( Music Act: No Selection  , however I am open to discuss other alternatives. For the presentation task ( Presentation Tasks: No Selection )  I would exclude the shared activities since this would require too much coordination and this is not in the sense of the event. Probably you also want to do the speech on the conference, don't you?   Iï¿½m looking forward to discuss these issues with you. I badly want to win this competition together with you and if we share our competences we will have a strong probability to do so.   Greetings,     Alex
Dear Alex, thank you for the nice introduction. Iï¿½m sure that our collaboration will be successful and Iï¿½m looking forward working with you.  I think the success of the 40th anniversary is in our both interest and I will do my best to win the competition in team with you. Like you said there are still a few points we have to discuss. First of all, I think we can agree on the Date of Conference. Week 3 works best for me. Presentation Tasks: null: You have guessed right, it would prefer it to do the speech, but we can hold that point back for later negotiation as a bonus for  Catering: local Russian cuisine   and Music Act: Local Russian band  : I think we cannot agree on that point. In my opinion the 40th anniversary is way too special for a buffet. You are right, walking around freely gives a pleasant atmosphere, but guests that are invited expect a certain level of professionality and elegancy. I donï¿½t think that standing up every now and then to get more food is appropriate. Furthermore the catering should contain at least 3 cores. For both catering and music act, I think it would be best to stay with local Russian culture. To my knowledge it was always beneficial to let the local guests feel homelike. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  : The last point I want to negotiate is the sponsor selection. I understand your suggestion to choose Art Inc. But in my opinion the financial security is more important than a one-time investment (potentially). Also I think that the contract for upcoming events outweighs the little less payment. Thatï¿½s my point of view, but I am very willing to respond to proposals! Greetings,   Chris
Dear Chris, thank you for your counteroffer and the detailed depicted arguments on each issue. Iï¿½m also happy that we already stated the date of the event on Week 3 ( Date of Conference: Week 3)  . However, as you might have expected, I would like to make some suggestions on changes so that we can hopefully come up with a fair compromise. Particularly I like your point of using the presentation task issue as a bonus. Following is my proposal and I hope that we can come to an accommodation with these issues: Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Youï¿½ve mentioned some important arguments for choosing Boomerang. Nevertheless I still would clearly favor Art Inc. since I see the approaching end of an important partnership with Art Inc. if we take Boomerang as our new sponsor. However I would make concessions in this point if you do the same in the following point.   Catering: International buffet  I do understand your arguments for the local Russian cuisine as you consider especially the business partners expecting some level of professionalism. Nevertheless itï¿½s still a student organization and in my opinion we should keep this image and stay with the international buffet and a relaxed atmosphere for the anniversary . The business partners will definitely establish more contacts with that kind of catering and this is lastly the purpose why they attend such an event.   Probably this is also a main issue for you and so I would like to offer you in addition to Boomerang that you could also make the opening speech (Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  ). Iï¿½ve heard that the winner team is also offered a job in the new office and so this would be the perfect occasion to put yourself forward to the job, if you would like to do so.    Music Act: FreeLife   A local band would have been nice if mainly Russian business partners had attended the anniversary. Since it is an international event I think that a local band doesnï¿½t fit the character of such a meeting. What do you think about meeting in the middle choosing the PopBand FreeLife to keep hopefully all guests satisfied and not primarily the Russians?   As you said in your last offer that you are willing to respond to proposals I would like you to do so. I hope this offer made some improvements for you and Iï¿½m still open to discuss these points. I'm looking forward to your answer.   Greetings,   Alex
Dear Alex, Iï¿½m already very pleased with your offer and very willing to take it. But before I accept the offer and end the negotiation I just want to verify if there isnï¿½t some potential for both of us left.  I see that catering is an important point for both of us. What do you think of changing the sponsor selection to your favour (Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  ) and therefore taking my suggestion on Catering: local Russian cuisine  ? Iï¿½m happy to agree to the other points, but Iï¿½m also willing to discuss these further more. If you are not satisfied with these changes, please give me a quick response and I will accept your last offer. Greetings,   Chris
Dear Chris, I'm happy to read that you were very pleased with my last offer. Also I do really like your style to not just accepting the offer but rather thinking of further progress of our negotiation that could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'm afraid that there is no potential left to improve these issues further for both parties. The reason therefore is that the catering is a really important issue for me since I want to keep the relaxed style for a student's organization event. I've planned many student events in the past and so I think you can realy on me when I say that this kind of catering would be the right decision in the sense of a successful event. On the other side I rather rely on your sponsor's selection since you have a lot of experience in this kind of business. So I think this would be a quite good deal in the sense of a successful event if we choose Boomerang as our sponsor. Beyond that you will (as already discussed) receive the bonus for the speech since you also made some concessions in the catering issue. I'm looking forward when you accept my last offer and I would like to thank you in advance for a pleasant negotiation. We will see each other hopefully for the planning of the real event in the planning commitee. Greetings, Alex
Dear Alex, Like I said, Iï¿½m happy to accept your offer and I hope that this decision is satisfactory for both of us. Iï¿½m sure, that we have done a good job on selecting a happy medium. Thank you for the nice negotiation and I hope to see you soon in the planning committee! Greetings,   Chris
Dear Chris, I am writing you regarding the conference and 40th anniversary of ISA. Although I didnï¿½t meet you jet, I am lucky to have such an experienced partner. Your connections to the business partners of the ISA combined with my experience of planning events could be very helpful for us to win this challenge. As this is a team competition, I think the only way to dominate is by being honest to each other and concentrate on the main goal - to reach a good overall result. So, enclosed I sent you a possible solution how to plan the event. Since this is an event with guests from all over the world, I thought it would be useful to have an Catering: International buffet  so that everyone gets replete. About the date of the conference. Since in the second week the ISAï¿½s vice president are unavailable it would be inconsiderate to set the event up to this date by knowing they cannot take part. Additionally they are probably the ones who evaluate the event so it would be bad for winning the competition. Week five is right around Christmas so I think one opinion could be  Date of Conference: Week 4 . As I already mentioned this is an international event so a famous act would be pretty good. I think Music Act: FreeLife  would be a great choice. About the presentation, I think it would not be fair if one of us would held it, an external speaker could be a great alternative, since we could find a famous one and an outstanding person, telling something positive about your organization always is better as self-praise. Presentation Tasks: Third person   To the sponsor selection I can say, that Art Inc. is a long-time sponsor of ours. Thus Boomerang said that they will maybe sign a long-term contract their offer is slightly less which means less money for our event. Additional accepting Boomerangs offer could disgruntle Art Inc. which should not be an opinion since their support should continue in the future. I think Corporate Ltd. and Documenta are not an opinion since their offers are very low in comparison to the ones of the others. Therefore Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   would be a great opinion.     All in all I think this could be a great possibility to set up the event. I am looking forward to hear your opinion about the conference and the 40th anniversary of ISA. Thanking you in advance for your response. Yours sincerely, Alex.
Chri's 1st CounterOffer: ISA conference and 40th anniversary
Dear Chris, I think something went wrong, I did not receive your message. It would be great if you could sent it again, here in the question section. Kind regards, Alex.
"Hello and sorry, but I took the wrong browser. First of all thank you for your concept. It is also my understanding to find a convincing concept in order to win the competition. I agree with you that it is important to be honest with each other so I want point out my opinion of your concept in an honest way. Regarding the fact that is the secand try in Russia I would prefer a local approach and so we should rather take a russian influcenced Catering:local Russian cuisine and Music Act:Local Russian band. For the presentaton it is definitly neccessary that two of us perform ourselves: I'm very well experienced in holding speed in front of big audience and so I would prefer  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex For the conference date I don't fully agree with you to choose week four. I would prefer week three, because it is not so near to christmas Date of Conference:Week3 - ? In your concept you mention Boomerang as a sponsor; basicly I prefer Sponsor Selection:Boomerang rather than Art Inc. because of its sustainability. But in order to find one concept out of your and my ideas, I can very well follow your choice in this aspect."
Dear Chris, That sounds great, I think we will manage to come to an agreement soon. First of all I can comprehend your position about the Week four and so I am willing to accept Date of Conference: Week 3  , since you offered me to have Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. as a sponsor. On the other hand, since it is still an international event, I unfortunately cannot accept your decision about the catering and the music act. I did not know that the speech is important for you so my proposal would be, that I, as you already mentioned, do the awards and leave the speech up to you, if you would be willing to accept the International Buffet and something else than the local Russian band. I hope you can agree with some of my suggestions or bring up new one. Kind regards, Alex.
  Thank you for your offer, but due to former experiences concerning the failed start in Russia, I am definitely convinced, that it is essential to find a close connection to the local culture. In my view this connection is the USP of the whole event. The event should be a very special unique occasion and not an event that could happen anywhere else.  Thatï¿½s why I recommend  Catering: local Russian cuisine  once again. This could suit to some other music (eg. Music Act: FreeLife  ) as well.        
Dear Chris, I came towards your offer with the date of the conference and the presentation tasks, you were willing to accept Art Inc. as a sponsor. For me it is really important that our guests feel well so I realy donï¿½t like to have a russian buffet and music act. Maybe we can arrange if we take your favourite sponsor Boomerang instead of Art Inc.? Wish you a good evening and looking forward to your response, Alex.
Dear Alex. I' am really not convinced of Catering: International buffet  I think we should definitivly have a local reference, so I want give up the decision of Music Act: Local Russian band . Looking forward to your answer, Chris
Dear Chris, I think your last offer does not completely match your last message, but I see your intension. So I would offer you another posibility which I think could be a solution. We take Week 3 and Boomerang as you wanted, additionally the local russian band. instead I would have the International Buffet and i would hold the Speech.   Looking forward to your opinion about this offer, Alex.
Thank you for your lost offer. For me it is okay and so i will accept your ideas. It was pleasure to have such a competent partner. All the best for you.    
Dear Chris, regarding the opening event of our new office in Saint Petersburg, we need to solve some organizational issues regarding our event concept. The first issue concerns the date of the event. I looked at the calender and the third week of december is the optimal choice, since there aren't any conflicting events and it's still a few days away from Christmas. Second, we need to clarify the presentation tasks during the opening of the event. Since there are two speeches to be held, I suggest that I cover the opening speech and you can do the award ceremony speech. Also we need to decide on catering. A buffet with an international mixture of meals would be perfect. That way everybody is able to find something they like. Also, beeing able to move around and talk while eating would encourage people to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances. For the later evening we also need to book a musical act for entertainment. During the last years, the guests haven't been very satisfied with the music at ISA events. Therefore I recommend we try to book DJ Happy, since he is a very famous performer who regularly fills huge venues and will attract many guests, which could then in turn be interested in the ISA. Last but not least, we need a sponsor for the event. Art Inc. made the best offer out of all interested sponsors. Furthermore they are a long time partner and the ISA has always had a good relationship with them. Please let me know what you think of my proposal.   Kind regards Alex
Dear Alex, thank you for your mail, I am very glad to work with you on this project. Here are my suggestions regarding the points you mentioned. I absolutely agree, that the third week of December is the optimal choice. It is the time when people are relaxed, looking forward to the coming holidays and overall changes in their lives. So itï¿½s a good time to attract new partners. I also donï¿½t mind you doing the opening speech and me taking the awards. Regarding catering I suggest we have to show every sort of respect here. I lived in Russia myself for a while and got to know the culture. Russians don't like buffets, they like to be served properly and expect a certain level of formality. I am convinced that a dinner of local Russian cuisine is the best choice. This also suits the purpose of showing appreciation to our new partners: we know your taste, we are ready to play on your terms. I agree that DJ Happy is a very famous and successful performer. But his overwhelming success also has its dark side for us: the focus of the event should stay on ISA and should not shift to DJ Happy. It is our event after all. I think a local Russian band is a more suitable choice. It is a perfect way to show our respect to the local culture. Moreover our potential partners would appreciate it since itï¿½s always nice to hear something they are familiar with. You are right that Art Inc. made the highest bet and i appreciate their cooperation. Boomerang also made a very generous offer. And what is more important, they are willing to sign a long-term sponsoring contract. This would provide financial security for several upcoming events. The money offered by Boomerang is more than enough. And written is written, who knows what Art Inc. decides next, it is good to have a contract in the hand. I hope you are agree with my argumentation, looking forward to hear from you. Kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, thank you for your response. Iï¿½m glad we could already decide on a date for the event and on the speeches during the opening ceremony. Unfortunately, the other issues will need further discussion. I appreciate that you want to incorporate some Russian culture into the event. However, having local Russian cuisine for dinner AND a Russian band as a musical act would be too much. After all the ISA is an international organization with members of many countries, so the event shouldnï¿½t entirely focus on the location of the new office. Furthermore, most of our potential partners are multinational corporations with employees from other countries too, not just Russia. Regarding the catering it is important that we satisfy all people, so no one is hungry and hence leaves the event early to get food somewhere else (Also hungry people are usually not in a good mood). I think this will be very hard, if we only serve Russian food, since many of our members and potential partners are not familiar with it and may not like it. In my opinion the easiest way to satisfy everybody would still be the buffet, since everybody can pick the things he likes. Also as I mentioned earlier it would encourage people to make new acquaintances, which is one of the main goals of the event. To show appreciation to our new Russian partners we could include some Russian specialties in the buffet. Considering the musical act, I would be willing to agree to hiring a Russian band to show our respect to the local culture, if we get the buffet for catering. Having Russian music combined with some Russian food in the buffet is enough appreciation for the location of the new office.  For sponsoring I still would suggest Art. Inc. They have been a very long time partner with ISA and therefore I am sure they will also sponsor our events in the future, even without a binding contract. Also, since the sponsor will be prominently displayed with banners and give a short presentation, it is important that we can trust the sponsor, which is definitely the case with Art Inc., since we only made good experiences with them in the past. Moreover, Boomerang is a direct competitor of Art Inc., so they might not be willing to sponsor our events in the future if we now choose Boomerang. Imagine we are not satisfied with the sponsoring of Boomerang, then we are not able to go back to Art. Inc. This is not the case the other way around, since Boomerang still wants to sponsor us, even though we worked with Art. Inc. in the past. Therefore, we could still keep Boomerang as a fall back solution for future events, if Art Inc., against all odds, decides they want to quit sponsoring. Last but not least, they still made the best offer, so why would we take the risk of choosing a new sponsor and at the same time take less money? I hope you understand my concerns with your proposal. Looking forward to getting your answer. Kind regards Alex
Dear Alex, thank you for your response. Iï¿½m glad you support my idea to take the Russian band. I hope the further negotiation will also go in an integrative way. I talked to my russian friends who are going to be at the event (some of them are our potential partners) and they totally support the idea of an official dinner and russian cuisine. On the other hand I agree with you that not everyone could possibly like the Russian food. I think we should meet at the point of international three course meal. Since itï¿½s our 40th Anniversary, the fleur of the event being formal and ceremonial is important. We have to make an impression! People will still have enough time to talk to each other after the dinner, there will be a cocktail party afterwards. Regarding the sponsoring i still find Boomerang better. Every lawyer would say that no one should prefer the deal without a contract over a deal with a contract. It is too risky to work without a contract in every business environment. And risks are putting us at costs in the long run. You said it yourself, that Arc Inc. can abandon us anytime and with Boomerang we are secured. Only imagine, we won't have to even think of money for the next couple of years!  Art Inc. could also propose us a contract, but they never did. The Boomerang already has the contract ready and there are no unexpected things in there. So there is no way we can not be satisfied because we know everything beforehand. They have a good reputation and name. If we take Art Inc. now, Boomerang can change their mind and go to our direct competitor Worldwide Students Organisation. Then we stay with our risks in the pocket. I think eliminating the risks is the most suitable strategy for ISA therefore I am absolutely convinced that Boomerang is the best choice in the long perspective. I hope you find with my argumentation reasonable and we can agree upon this. Kind regards   Chris
Dear Chris, thank you for your answer. I'm afraid you misunderstood my proposal. Since we both wanted different options for music and catering, I suggested hiring a Russian band and the international buffet as a compromise for both of us. Meaning I am only agreeing to a Russian band, IF we also get the international buffet in return. The deadline for submitting our proposal is approaching quickly. Therefore, and since it seems very important to you, I am willing to agree to taking Boomerang as a sponsor. I also see the befenits of a long term contract. Since we only have briefly two hours left and I don't know if I'm able to answer again in that short timespan, this will be my final offer. I think it's a good proposal, regarding the opionions of both of us. I really hope you agree, since I would really like to submit a proposal for organizing this event. Kind regards Alex
Dear Alex, Thank you for the answer. You are right about the time and I think the overall combination is reasonable now, although I am not completely agree on the buffet. Anyway, I accept your offer to support the team spirit :) Kind Regards,  Chris
Good morning Chris, hope you're doing well! I am really eager to plan the annual conference and 40th anniversary of ISA together with you and your long-term experience! I relly would like to win this competition - from joining ISA in 2009 on, I already planned and organized smaller events which were very successful. That's why I would like to prove ISA that I can plan bigger events together with you as an experienced team member! During the last events, I realized how necessary it is to have some time left when it gets closer to the event. Therefore, I propose to agree on a concept soon to start a detailled planning. Attached you find my first proposal with the most important facts in my opinion. As the name of the international Student Association ISA says it, I would like to set up an international evening with an easy-going networking atmosphere for both business partners and our students. Therefore, I suggest the international buffet as many of our international guests might not be familiar with the Russian cuisine. With an international selection of food, everbody will find something they like. Students will feel comfortable with a buffet as they can easily stroll around and find someone to talk to. As students are the basis of ISA, I want to focus on them. Attracting students means attracting businesses for me, because companies are looking for attractive young employees. We can promote the annual conference by having an amazing get-together atmosphere for both talented students and various business partners. Regarding another very important issue, I opt for Art Inc. as a sponsor. First of all, they already made the best offer for this event, which means we will have the highest budget here. With this additional budget, we might plan a special effect like a giveaway and have something, the other student teams might not have within their concept. Secondly, we already have a long and good relationship with Art Inc. which is based on trust - that is something ISA is known for and that's something we should strengthen with the annual conference. Even without further contracts, Art Inc. supported as in the past and I am sure that they will support as in the future, too. Whereas having their main competitor Boomerang as a sponsor for such an important event might weaken our relationship with Art Inc. for ever - this seems to be very dangerous to me. Firstly, we might lose the relationship with Art Inc. and secondly, other companies might see that we easily switch from one corporation to their competitior. This might affect relationships to other companies negatively, too. Regarding the date, I opt for week 3 as there is some time left until Christmas and our higher ranked members might attend the annual conference. As I already said, I prefer an international orientation and therefore, I suggest DJ Happy as many dynamic guests might be attracted by him. These guests in turn could be very interested in ISA. So far, these are my suggetions - I am looking forward to hearing from you and to select a concept soon as I already said to focus on a detailed plan. What do you think? By having a detailed plan and maybe adding some extras to the concept, we might win the competition! Looking forward to working with you and to organizing everything in reality! Regards, Alex    
Good Morning Alex! Nice to hear about you, first of all I want to say that I hope we could be a very good team. I saw your proposal but I would like to know your opinion about the Presentation Tasks: null  . What is your proposal about this? When I received this information, I'll send you my proposal and my point of view. Regards,   Chris
Hi Chris, I added the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris . Regards, Alex
Good morning Alex, Thanks for sent me your proposals, as I told you if we could be a great team, Iï¿½m sure we can reach to the best solution for the team (both). I analized carefully all your needs and as a first proposal I think it is really interesting so I would like to give you my point of view of your proposal and later I can give you mine.  First of all, Iï¿½m completely agree with the date of conference, at the beginning I was a bit confusing with the dates but with your proposal I guess that the third week is the best option we have for celebrate the conference, so we shouldn't have problems with this aspect. Secondly, I would like to know if you are completely sure that you want to do the opening speech since I have a lot of experience in speeches so for me it shouldnï¿½t be difficult and one advantage of this is that we could focus our time in another aspects that could be more important for our team and for the conference. Thirdly, I see very smart from your side to give an international buffet since everyone come from different countries. Russian cuisine could not be familiar for our guests but a very interesting point to consider is that this year we celebrate this conference in Russia so why we shouldnï¿½t take benefit of this and give our guests a local pleasant surprise for their palate! Maybe Russian cuisine is not the Spanish one but there a lot of magnificent Russian food so think about it and let me know about this. Fourthly the music act, I love music like International Pop, Garage UK (Deep House) ï¿½ from DJ Happy so Iï¿½m sure that many people like me will focus their attention on the DJ instead of the ISA event Donï¿½t you think? And Finally (and not less important) our Sponsor selection, it is true that Art Inc. made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event but we should change our point of view to the financial perspective of ISA because it is really important. Donï¿½t you think that is better to have a long-term contract instead of just words? We are talking about money and when we talk about money we just worried about our interests, everything else is not important for our main interest and this it should be to guarantee the financial perspective of ISA for the upcoming years. This is a plus for us if we select Boomerang!   So for now we are agree: - Date of Conference: Week 3  
Good morning Chris, thanks for your opinions regarding the open topics! I absolutely see your point with the speech. Same here, as I already organized various smaller events it was always up to me to hold the speech. Thatï¿½s why I offered straight away to hold the speech and to prepare it. Still you have to chance to hand out the awards to the winners. I thought, this task might suit you as you are very convenient with business partners due to your internships and experience. Therefore I do not hesitate to have the additional work load with preparing the speech ï¿½ we just should agree upon it soon to start with the speech. Nevertheless, I think sponsor selection and catering are more relevant issues: I still opt for having an international buffet or at least for having an international three course meal ï¿½ internationality is still important to me. Regarding the remaining open issues, please send me your offer ï¿½ afterwards we can discuss the issues in detail. Regards, Alex
"Hi Alex, Here is my proposal, please analize it and give me your opinions about it. I'm pretty sure we can reach to an agreement ;) Regards, Chris"
Hi Chris, thanks for your last offer - regarding the sponsor selection I see your point. Boomerang might be an option. So what do you think about this offer? For the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang ? And regarding the Music Act: FreeLife  might be a more suitable background music which doesn't seems to be the main event of this evening. Looking forward to hearing from you! Regards, Alex
Hello Alex, Thanks for your last offer! I like how we are gradually gaining an understanding. This offer tries to get the best for both. For the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   and the Date of Conference: Week 3   I guess we don't have any doubt, but for the Presentation Tasks: Shared activities   you have to understand that I want to do the opening speech so I would like to know what kind of flexibility do you have for it? what about if we could shared this activity?. For the Music Act: FreeLife  and Catering: local Russian cuisine   let's say that you can choose the music but you have to let me choose the Local russian cuisine for the catering. Let me know what do you think about this offer. Regards
Hi Chris,   I am also appreciating our steps towards a concepts which fits both of us. Regarding Sponsor Selection: Boomerang , I agree with your proposal if we combine the following issues like this: Date of Conference: Week 3  is nothing we need to discuss about any longer and Music Act: FreeLife  will be a compromise which will suit both of us, I guess. I see that you absolutely want to hold the speech! I appreciate your strong will and therefore, I propose that you are going to hold the speech and I am going to do the awards as shared activities won't help us that much - both of us have effort to prepare the speech and also the audience might be confused and it will be difficult to listen to the speech. Therefore, I offer you to do hold the speech in case we will stay with an international buffet or at least an international three course menu. As with an international menu we can combine Russian and delicious Spanish food - a super combination both for our host country and the international audience who might not be used to Russian food that much - think of all the religions we have to combine for this special event! I think this is a super compromise, especially for you personally, as you have the chance to hold the speech and reach a broad audience. I guessthe speech will have a huge impact for your career!   As time flies, we should come to an agreement soon. Lokking forward to hearing from you. Best regards, Alex
Hi Alex, I need you to come down on the selection of the Catering/Music Act, we need some local Russian cuisine or music because it will suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. So this is my last proposal for you, looking forward to hearing from you!  
Hi Alex, I see your point regarding the Music Act: Local Russian band. Here is my response to your last offer - I made a lot of concessions so far and I hope we can come to a concept here. Best regards, Alex
Hi Alex, I'm not getting a warm feeling about the Sponsor as we talked before, let's do it like this. King regards, Chris
Hi Chris, being honest, I can't make that many concessions. Seems like I am the only one who makes concessions: you can hold the speech Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex , you have the local performance of the Music Act: Local Russian band   and I followed your preference with the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang ! For me, it seems like a super offer for you - hope you agree :-) Therefore, find attached my last offer - looking forward to come to a final concept.   Regards, Alex
"Hi Alex, Ok I found your last offer really good ;) so I accepted and I hope we could see each other soon.   Regards,  "
Dear Chris, How are you doing? I hope everything is just fine! As agreed upon, I enclose this message with my concept, as to how I would solve our open issues. Kindly let me know, if you have any questions regarding my offer. Sponsor:  Boomerangï¿½s offer, more specifically the prospect of signing a long-term contract with them, does have a certain appeal. However, there are three reasons why I would go along with Art Inc nonetheless: First of all, the budget that Art Inc is willing to provide for our celebration would leave us virtually free of any money-related constraints that might otherwise restrict our plans. (And Iï¿½d like to think that a 40th anniversary party is the wrong place for being miserly!) Secondly: ï¿½Never change a running systemï¿½, is what I say. Art Inc has always been our steady, faithful and reliable partner. Going over their heads by displaying their competitorï¿½s banner at one of our most historic events would be considered a grave insult, which might render any future deals with Art Inc impossible. I wouldnï¿½t want to risk such a fruitful and proven relationship for a new one, whose success would be rather uncertain. My third point concerns our credibility: Scorning one of our must trusted partners might leave other (potential) partners uneasy and reluctant to deal with us in the future, if they felt that we didnï¿½t honor implicit/relational components of our contracts. If on the other hand we stay true to Art Inc, their spokesperson would most likely be very willing to emphasize our exceptional reliability and diligence during his speech, if you can follow my meaning. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Music Act:  As you know, the music acts weï¿½ve been hosting in the past, have not exactly proven to be very popular with our audience (to put it mildly), especially with the students. A musical act at our 40th anniversary party, who is adored by young people, would be considered symbolic for the fact that we acknowledge students to be our most prized and valued asset, and that we are still an agile and youthful organization. And in comes DJ Happy! I think he requires no further introduction. An act like DJ Happy would surely attract countless students, locals and global ones alike, who would in turn be prospective ISA member. Since heï¿½s critically acclaimed amongst young people all over the world, we wouldnï¿½t have to worry about the scope of his appeal either. Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation tasks: If we turn out to be the winners of Dr. Illenschitzï¿½s tournament, I think it would be only appropriate for us to be involved in the opening ceremony in person, donï¿½t you think? I consider myself a rather eloquent & confident person, thatï¿½s why Iï¿½d love to hold the opening speech. Judging by our previous discussions, you must be an eloquent person too, so I really think that you are the right man to hold the equally prestigious award speech. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Date of the conference: The 3rd week would allow for all high-ranking officials (of both within and outside our organization) to attend. Any earlier timeslot would either conflict with the International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow or our own officialsï¿½ schedule. And letï¿½s not forget Christmas! Any possible timeslot after the 3rd week would be dangerously close to Christmas Eve. Date of Conference: Week 3   Catering: I favor an international buffet which would meet two very important requirements: Diversity and informality. We are expecting guests from all over the world, all of them accustomed to very different tastes/cuisines. Every guest should be able to combine foods and ingredients to his liking in a ï¿½To each his ownï¿½-manner. This would also give us the opportunity to serve local specialties as well, which would surely be considered a friendly gesture by our (potential) Russian partners. On top of that, I really want to increase peopleï¿½s opportunities to socialize and network to the maximum. A buffet which allows for people to eat and move freely would offer ideal framework conditions for this purpose. Catering: International buffet   Well, thatï¿½s it! Thanks for reading my concept. Iï¿½m really looking forward to hear from you. Have a nice week and best regards, Amin P.S.: I will be very busy today, so donï¿½t wonder, if I donï¿½t answer immediately.      
" Dear Alex,   Thank you for your message! I'm actually quite good because I just ended my exams and I am getting close to my graduation (so close that I have a lot a free time!)! And you, how are you doing?    First of all, I would like to thank you for all the great work you did and for the precise analysis of the ""hot"" topics you gave me. To make it easier to read, I will answer to your proposition in the same order as you did.   Sponsor:    To answer to your first point, the overall money provided by Boomerang would be more than enough to cover all the costs of the event (even in the worst case). Your second point must be the most difficult to tackle because this is true, Art Inc has always been our steady partner. I really don't like the idea of cutting them straight. But here is a hard reality that I heard from a managing partner of Art Inc while I was working with him (donï¿½t repeat it, I shouldnï¿½t be speaking of it to anyone): because of financial purposes, they are going to cut every sponsorships next year. This being stated, I see no other reliable option than choosing Boomerang. And by the way, my contact in Art Inc told me he could make a public announcement saying that they chose to stop our partnership so that other potential partners donï¿½t think we are not trustworthy. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang       Music Act:    I know that the music acts weï¿½ve been hosting in the past, has not exactly proven to be very popular with students. Thatï¿½s the reason why we completely have to change our strategy. You are right saying that ï¿½A musical act at our 40th anniversary party, who is adored by young people, would be considered symbolic for the fact that we acknowledge studentsï¿½ but the president and I strongly disagree with your option of choosing DJ happy. I have previously been to a DJ Happy show and believe me, this is amazing. But when I say ï¿½amazingï¿½, I mean that it is too famous and that students will only come to our event because of the show and not for the celebration. Then, the companies will see it and we will be considered as an association organizing amazing student music shows under the pretext of ISA to raise money. To that extent, the president of ISA and I would definitely prefer to choose a local music band.    Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation tasks:   I totally agree on this point because I think that both of us are as eloquent and easy talking as the other. And I am really happy that you find the two tasks equally prestigious! Personally, I would prefer to make the opening speech. I think I can assume that itï¿½s all right with you?   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Date of the conference:   Your analysis has 100% convinced me, I donï¿½t want to change anything to it.    Date of Conference: Week 3   Catering:   This point is the most problematic from my personal point of view. Reading you, I have the feeling that you donï¿½t really know what Russian food looks like and how it tastes. I am personally quite aware of Russian cuisine because my mother is from Russia and I can assure you that no matter where our guest come from, they are always amazed by this food! Then, as you said, ï¿½Never change a running systemï¿½: our guests have always been glad to taste new meals and to discover new culture every time our organization opened a new subsidiary. There is a last point I would like to tackle: the kind of meal. As you know, our organization always does a real menu. 4 years ago, we tried to do an international Buffet, which happened to be a failure because the companies told us that ï¿½Having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes.ï¿½ This is the reason why we did a real menu during the 2 previous years which were always a success. Finally, I would like to inform you that 3 years ago, on the occasion of the attempt at organizing a ï¿½buffetï¿½, Art INC present managing partner and many other of our partners told me that the standing time was too long and that it was not pleasant to be put straight away with unknown people right at the beginning of the event because at that time, they donï¿½t know anyone else. They strongly prefer being sitting at a table to meet a few people in the beginning of the evening and then to meet some others during the champagne event that is taking place right after the dinner. All in all, I see no other option than preparing a local cuisine dinner. Catering: local Russian cuisine         Well, thatï¿½s all for me! I really want us to find a solution before the end of the week, otherwise the event couldnï¿½t take place under appropriate conditions. Please, feel free to tell me what you think of my propositions!   Have a nice week,   Chris  "
"Hi again Chris, :) Iï¿½m very happy to hear that! Have you already completed your thesis? I canï¿½t complain either, thank you. However, my semester has basically just started! Thanks for your message, I enjoyed it. I appreciate the fact that you value good manners as much as I do. Even more than your attitude, I value your effort and assessment. Based on your input, I have been contemplating a lot of ifs and whens, and I have come to the conclusion that most of our differences can surely be resolved, if we work together and listen to each other closely. At first glance, your approach and mine seem to greatly differ from each otherï¿½ but do they really? I think our only problem lies within the one-sidedness of our approaches (yours and mine alike): I feel safe to say, that we can agree on the fact that we need both ï¿½supplyï¿½ and ï¿½demandï¿½ in order to survive: The companies are the demand side of our equation. More specifically, they are demanding the worldï¿½s most promising potential leadership talents, whom we are able to ï¿½supplyï¿½ better than anyone else. One canï¿½t exist without the other: If we neglected our business partners, they would stop collaborating with us. Our money sources would run dry, weï¿½d lose all of our job opportunities, and in turn even our most loyal students would be abandoning. I do realize that now. Thatï¿½s why I definitely see a lot of merit in your approach. However, you on the other hand should bear in mind that neglecting our student patronage would be equally devastating for us: Our business partners come to us, because we ï¿½supplyï¿½ them with some of the best students out there, not because of the fancy dinner parties we are throwing (at least not primarily ;) ).  If we ran out of promising students due to their contempt for our events, weï¿½d have nothing left to supply anymore, and would in turn lose all of our business partners as well. So, I honestly believe that you and I are no adversaries at all. On the contrary, I think we are balancing each other out nicely. Weï¿½re part of the same medal, and together we may find the golden mean, if we agree on one major truth: We need the both of them, supply and demand. Letï¿½s not lose any of them due to negligence.   I have restructured my offer based on your input which (I hope) will now be more to your liking. First of all, Iï¿½d like to mention that I am very happy that we were able to agree on Date of Conference: Week 3  . It shows that we both are reasonable planners. As for the rest: Sponsor: Your information as an insider of Art Inc is highly valuable for our organization.  And donï¿½t worry: Your secret is safe with me and I am grateful that you have shared it with me. However, I donï¿½t see this having much of an impact on our current planning. In my opinion, thatï¿½s a problem for another day. Art Inc has already earned its place of honor, period. Ceasing to sponsor us in the future does not undo the support they have already provided us with until now. All in all I canï¿½t help but feel that ditching them like that would violate the reciprocity principle. I also seriously doubt theyï¿½d be willing to hold a favorable speech at our celebration, once they learned that theyï¿½d have to deliver under the banner of one of their fiercest competitors. I concur, the sum Boomerang would be bringing up for our celebration is decent, but still considerably less than Art Incï¿½s. Donï¿½t forget that we wouldnï¿½t have to spend the entire budget either: We would make use of the surplus by investing in other projects. And while Boomerang has proposed a long-term contract, they have yet to come up with numbers. So far, they have done nothing that would earn them a special place at our 40th anniversary party. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Music Act: Thank you so much for your counsel. Wellï¿½ I still think that DJ Happy would be the best solution for our purpose, but as mentioned in my introduction, I must face the fact that he wouldnï¿½t be a very balanced onceï¿½ so Iï¿½m at least partially inclined to agree with you: While being perfect for young people, he might alienate our more mature and grounded business partners, indeed. However, I do not see how this would necessarily lead us to a local band. A local Russian bandï¿½s appeal is equally limited and does not cover the full scope of our target groups either. I can definitely picture our local business partners appreciating the gesture and some of the local students will be enjoying a band like that as well, but what about the other guests? We are still an expressively international organization, and it is part of our corporate identity that we choose universalistic/cosmopolitan programs over national ones. I know that Russia is very special for us, but I still think that we should maintain some sense of corporate integrity. And even from a purely pragmatic view, I canï¿½t imagine guests from other parts of the world enjoying folk music that they are not familiar with at all. That is why I propose the band FreeLife as a compromise. The bandï¿½s appeal is rather universal. They are a very safe solution (somewhat like ï¿½lukewarm waterï¿½ if you will): Some will like them (students and business partners alike), some will be indifferent, but no one will be offended or grossed out. Music Act: FreeLife   Presentation: Letï¿½s say it like it is: We both want to do the exact same thing, and we both would be able to deliver. Thatï¿½s what makes it all the more difficult for me to come up with a balanced solution. There are simply no ï¿½hard factsï¿½ which would favor either you or me holding the speech. Even though Iï¿½d love to hold the opening speech, I propose the following: Letï¿½s take one step back and hire a professional to do the talking. A professional speaker might outmatch the both of us by far which would probably make him the best solution for ISA. Dr. Illenschitz would also be very impressed to see us getting over our own ego for the sake of the organization. What do you think? Presentation Tasks: Third person   Catering: First of all I would like to clarify that I didnï¿½t mean to insult your countryï¿½s cuisine in any way, and I apologize if my statement came across differently. Iï¿½m sure that Russian food is very tasty, but be that as it may: Marketing an international buffet that includes local specialties is much easier than marketing ï¿½Russian food onlyï¿½, since a great deal of our non-Russian guests would not be enthused to hear the latter at all. I think you will acknowledge this general tendency, even if you deny its factual legitimacy. That leads us to the next point: As I see it, this is not ï¿½Russian food vs non-Russian foodï¿½ but rather ï¿½food from different countries incl. Russia vs Russian food onlyï¿½. So, there will be Russian food either way. Well, the way the ï¿½buffet optionï¿½ had been implemented four years ago was rather unfortunate, I must agree. However, this time we have a real budget. We will be offering a high class buffet that will leave even our more skeptical business partners impressed and in awe, I assure you. I also concur, that no one should be forced to stand if he doesnï¿½t feel like doing so. But I think this issue can be resolved by offering chairs and tables, donï¿½t you agree? On top of that: Your attempt to satisfy our business partners wishes is very legit in this case as well, yet we also must ensure that there are ample opportunities for our two target groups to socialize appropriately. Our domain thrives on networking and we should not forget that (even if some of our partners obviously did, as youï¿½ve just mentioned). Catering: International buffet   Thanks for reading, dear friend! I agree 100 percent, weï¿½re in this together, and we definitely should reach an agreement in good time. However, I think we will turn out just fine! So far our messages take a lot of time, since we are discussing all issues at once, but it will be worth it. Have a nice week! Alex        "
  Dear Chris,   Thanks a lot for your answer! I really appreciate seeing that you take everything very seriously! I am really sorry to tell you this, but I wonï¿½t be able to contact you on Friday (maybe very early in the morning) because Iï¿½m taking a plane which will land after the end of the negotiation. Moreover, the key point for us is to find a compromise that will make our team valuable for the competition, but most of all that would make the event amazing. So here is what I propose.   We donï¿½t need to discuss the topic of the date anymore. Date of Conference: Week 3   First of all, concerning the choice of the sponsors, I really disagree with your approach which consists of saying that the fact that Art Inc wonï¿½t be our sponsor soon is not our problem because we, as persons wonï¿½t be there anymore. I think that this is the future of our association which is at stake and we canï¿½t simply ignore it to get more cash today. I think the only reasonable possibility is the choose Boomerang. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Then, I think the option you propose is worse than your first offer as long as in order to succeed, we need to appear as a team so both of us must be able to speak. Even if I would be very proud to make the opening speech, I am ready to let you do it while I would do the awards. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Then, I think you got a point with your approach of supply and demand. Therefore, even if this is not what I think is the best, I would agree choosing Freelife band which would definitely wonï¿½t be adored by the officials but that students would like a lot. Music Act: FreeLife   But as you said, we canï¿½t totally forget about Russia as long as this is our second attempt to work with them and that last time it failed. Thus, we should definitely propose our guest local Russian Cuisine.   Catering: local Russian cuisine     Well, thatï¿½s it! Thanks for reading everything I just told you. I have made some really hard concessions and I hope that you could do the same. Iï¿½m really looking forward to hear from you.   Have a nice week and best regards,   Chris
"Dear Chris, Thank you, too! And thanks for letting me know! I have a very similar problem, so I suggest the following: Letï¿½s come to an agreement by Thursday evening/night (CET). We may also shorten our messages from now on, because virtually all of our arguments are on the table already. I feel that I understand you and you understand me. Your counteroffer is very good. I really appreciate your concessions, and I know that they must have been hard for you to make. I have been thinking: Even though the both of us have agreed on FreeLife, neither of us is particularly happy with the solution. Also we donï¿½t seem to come to terms with catering at all. I think these two issues are closely related, since they determine the overall atmosphere and thus the way that our several target groups will perceive us and enjoy themselves. Ergo, these two issues should be negotiated in conjunction with each other. Catering & Music Act: Our balanced approach might be realized, if we went for FreeLife and an international three course meal. Both of us could live with a moderate solution like that for sure, but none of us would really be satisfied, since that would be neither fish nor fowl: It would alienate no one (which is very good), but it would also not be particularly appealing for anyone, neither for students nor for our business partners. However, there is another possibility for a balanced approach: If I agreed to book a local Russian band of your choosing, would you be willing to settle for an international buffet? Instead of ""neither & neither"" we'd be settling for ""Russian & International"" which would be equally balanced, yet more refined. Music Act: Local Russian band   Catering: International buffet   Sponsor & Presentation: There is one thing I have to clarify: It seems that with regard to Art Inc, I have failed to my point clear. When I said: ï¿½Thatï¿½s a problem for another dayï¿½, I didnï¿½t mean: ï¿½Devil may careï¿½! I just wanted to emphasize that I strongly disagree with the notion that Art Inc have somehow forfeited their place of honor, just because we wonï¿½t be working with them in the future. Honoring good service is a very, very important principle for me and I think it is a very important principle for any business/organization. I am moved by your generous offer to have me holding the opening speech. It means a lot to me and Iï¿½d greatly embrace the opportunity. However, honoring Art Incï¿½s support is of particular importance to me. It is so important to me, that Iï¿½d be willing to respectfully and gratefully return your offer: If you settled for Art Inc, you would be holding the opening speech instead of me. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Thanks again for your time! I hope I have been able to adjust my offer to your liking and to hear from you very soon. Have a nice evening! Date of Conference: Week 3        "
Dear Alex, First of all, I agree with your proposition to come to an agreement by Thursday evening/night (CET). By the way, thank you very much for the time you spent and the energy you used to make concessions. I really appreciate. I think we are really close to reach an agreement. First of all, I really appreciate the gesture for the presentation and I think that the compromise presentation/sponsor you offered is quite reasonable. Even if I think that presentation and sponsor are not of the same importance, I could agree on this point if you can get in my direction for the two remaining issues. Then, I think we both agree on the date, the sponsor and the presentation. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Date of Conference: Week 3   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   As I said, I think that in order to make this deal more equal between you and I, I propose you to select the band (so I guess you would take DJ Happy as you said that Freelife is an intermediate solution) and I would choose the Russian dinner in order to properly represent Russia. Music Act: DJ Happy   Catering: local Russian cuisine    I hope you understand my offer and I hope to hear from you very soon. Have a nice evening! Chris
"Dear Chris, Well, you really love your cuisine! :) I must say that the international buffet has basically been the core piece of my whole concept, and I wasn't prepared to give it up by any means. To put it more directly: The buffet means much more to me than DJHappy ever will. However, since you've always been a fair and courteous partner, I am potentially willing to break with my own ""iron rule"", so you can have your wish. All I'd ask in return is to hold the opening speech in addition to booking DJHappy. Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   See/hear you soon! :)"
Dear Alex,   I have to tell you that I am a bit disappointed because as we said before, I am giving you the sponsor selection which really mattered to me and on which we disagree if you were ready to go in my preference of choosing the dinner over the music for the Russian touch of the event AND that you let me make the opening speech. I have to tell you that I am a bit disappointed by your reaction. We still have the possibility the change our previous agreement on sponsor/presentation but it would change all the others parameters ... My previous offer still stands: Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.     I hope we will find a way to reach an agreement, Read you, Chris
Dear Chris, Your counteroffer differed from what I had in mind. So, the fact that I would have wanted to adjust my terms, after you had done the same, should really not offend you. This is a negotation after all, so no hard feelings. However, I won't deny that your offer is still sufficiently satisfying from my point of view. Consider this my final consent. We may submit the terms as mentioned in this offer to Dr. Illenschitz. Cheers! It was a real pleasure! See you in Russia. :) 
Dear Chris, it's great to work with you and I'm happy that we could already settle some of the tasks for the organization! There are still some issues which we have to decide and I would like to discuss these points with you. Please have a look on the attached offer for my proposal. We can get in touch tonight again for further discussion and I will gladly explain the details of my proposal! Let's get the best team concept and realize this glorious organization :) Best regards Alex
Dear Alex, How are you ? I hope you are fine. Because we are a team and I need you to be fine ! :) I analyzed your offer and I have to say your offer is a fairly promising start to discuss. But we still have some issues to sort out though. The atteched terms would be acceptable to me. First, the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  . I think you know how important the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  is for ISA. They offered us a long-term contract and I think you know how important a long-term contract is. In that contract, they would ensure the sponsoring of the future events of the ISA. Such contract would provide financial security for several upcoming ISA events and to some extent for the ISA itself. And we both know the financial issues are one of the most important subject for a company to being alive and being active in the business world. The other subject is Music Act: Local Russian band . This year's celebration being in Russia and our new office is in Saint Petersburg. So that, we have to make them feel important and appreciated by selecting the Local Russian band. Also, we can show our interest in the Russian culture. It's very important. And the strategy of the event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with local companies and officals. We can do it by selecting the Local Russian band. And of course Catering: local Russian cuisine As I said before, we should select the local choice. I think that local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. I think we both agree on that. We expect many important people to be there who expect a certain level of formality and most of them from Russia. So, again, we have to make them feel important and appreciated. If we want to have a good relationship with Russian people, we have to do this. It's very clear. And there is no problem for me about Date of Conference: Week 3  and Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris . We can do it as you want. That's okay for me.  Best regards, Chris
"Before looking at the attached traits, please have a look at my description as I described in detail my motives and also alternative choices for us to reach a compromising solution! Thanks :) Dear Chris, thank you so much for the highly-detailed and update and good to know that we could already find some common ground on some organizational issues! Your counteroffer is surely a good start but I would like to discuss with you the remaining three points in a more detailed manner as we might have some differing views on some topics. For the beginning let's review the Sponsor Selection. I totally agree with your view that regular, long-term financing is the lifeblood of our great organization and we wouldn't be able to afford opening new subsidiaries in new locations, let alone our goal of global expansion and becoming the leading international student organization. It is exactly because of this that I ask you to reconsider this choice. Let me explain it to you in more detail: Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. has been an all-weather partner of us since a very long time and for me, it was no wonder that they bid the highest short-term payment directly for the event. You see, ISA and Art Inc., they have history and can already look back to years of succesful cooperation and it's, in my opinion, highly likely that this cooperation will persevere, even without long-term contractual obligations. One of Art Inc 's fiercest competitor is, as you may very well know, the company which suggestively offered a binding long-term contract :) In my opinion it would be quite rude and strategically unfavorable to tarnish the good relations we have to Art Inc in favor of their direct and competitor. Feel free to give me your thoughts on that :) Now more importantly to the two remaining issues Catering and Music   I feel that we have a different vision of the nature of this celebration. I can totally understand your intention of serving local gastronomy and local music as a sign of respect to the host country, the Russian companies and certainly to the new members. But as one of the biggest international student organization it is exactly because of our multicultural approach that we attract so many talents to our global subsidiaries. Regarding the Catering: think about it, would you, for example as a German, be more amazed by an international buffer spanning from Asian cuisine to Mexican tacos and Spanish tapas or by having only traditional dishes just from your country? Please don't forget that this celebration is also mainly in place to gather our members and executives from all over the globe to our annual conference. From my experience in organizing events it is far from likely that everybody adapts to just one cuisine. I would hereby decidedly prefer the Catering: International buffet as people would not only be able to suit their tastes with lots of food-variety but also walk around and network, exacly how it should be on annual conferences! As an alternative I could also think of the international three course meal if it suits you more, even if this doesn't allow my degree of networking mobility. It still has a more international approach and gives our guests lots of variety to choose from. For the reasons stated I can't accept the one-sided local cuisine. As for the Music Act I can also tell you from my experience that in the last years we had many dissatisfied voices who comlained that we had ""lousy"" music. That's not acceptable! We are students and should be up-to-date with good contemporary music, right? I'm not sure how good this Russian band is, I don't even know if they sing in English. To avoid the bad experience of the past years at all cost I would have suggested either the internationally super-famous Music Act: DJ Happy or alternatively the still internationally renown band FreeLife. I'm happy with either of them, it should just be more than a ""famous local band"". We have to cater to a big international audience, as much as I like local bands individually, we have to deliver big names as a big organization with global aims! Please feel free to give me your input! I always believe in the ability to find a compromise in such situations! :) Have a good night! Kind regards Alex P.S.:Sry for the long and belated post, had some issues this evening ~"
I know that DJ Happy acts would probably be more attractive, especially for the younger generation, but the strategy of the event should be focused on establishing a good relationship with (local) companies and officials. I also think that DJ Happy is the worst option since there is no guarantee that his reputation would not overshadow the reputation of the ISA, distracting attention from the event towards the music act. I have heard about festivals with DJ Happy as the performer and I canï¿½t imagine to have ISA as a ï¿½side-actï¿½ to DJ Happy. So that we should chose Music Act: Local Russian band   Well, about Catering: International three course meal  I think having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. If you don't choose Local Russian Cuisine, that means we have only have one choice. International Three Course Meal. As you said, we have also international guests. So, International Three Course Meal is a good choice for Catering: International three course meal   And OK. I can you a comprimise about Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  but only for Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  in return.
"Dear Chris, thank you for the response! I'm happy that we could find a viable compromise regarding theCatering: International three course mealI would have significantly preferred a more flexible way of catering but at least we can cater the tastes of all our international guests. I might accept that! Regarding the choice for the Music Act, I can understand your train of thought regarding DJ Happy and I acknowledge that it's in your opinion the worst option, even if I think that it would be by far the better option to attract new members. On the other hand it is for me the worst option to hire a local band without international experience, which at best could only satisfy our Russian guests, a fraction of our audience. But as I see your displeasure with DJ Happy I'm prepared to meet you halfway. Through selecting Music Act: FreeLife we have a band, which is internationally more experienced and well-liked but also not that famous to overshadow our actual festivities. In my opinion it would be by far more attractive to choose this band than the local Russian band. It just doesn't fit the character of our international celebration. What do you think? Regarding the presentation tasks it would be quite important to me to hold the opening speech but if we can reach a compromise on the other issues I can consider giving you the honor of holding the speech! Hope we have a deal ;) Best regards Alex"
Dear Alex, Thank you for your response. And Im very happy to see that we have an agreement for all topics. It was good to negotiate with you. Thanks for your attention. Best regards... Chris
Hello Chris,  my Name is ï¿½Alexï¿½, I am from Germany and looking forward to work with you together on negoisst.  Regarding the upcoming event, herewith my proposal for the planning: Catering: Considering different options, I think most important is to have a look on our audience. Therefore its obvious: Most of the visitors will be from several intlï¿½ countries, so an international buffet will be the best option.  Date of Conference: I checked the schedule: Week 2 and 5 are unfortunately completely not possible for me. My suggestion is to plan the event for week 3. Music Act: Always a challenge to find a good musician ï¿½ but within the last months Iï¿½ve heard several times from a great band called ï¿½DJ Happyï¿½. I checked their prices and music videos online - and this sounds really good. Presentation Tasks: I think for the main presentation itï¿½s a good plan to have us both involved and split the presentation into speech and awarding. Assuming this is a good offer for you, I will leave the awarding up to you, as I think this is something youï¿½ll really like. I will therefore prepare the speech. Sponsor Selection: Since the ISA was supported for a long time by the ART Inc. I think itï¿½s clear to stay with this sponsor. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, ï¿½Alexï¿½
Dear Alex, Thank you for contacting me in such a short time and for your proposal for the planning. I agree with your proposed Date of Conference ( week 3) since it will not collide with any other events and our ranked members are available that week. However, I cannot completely accept your other proposals and I would like to renegotiate some of them. Catering: I agree with the fact that most of the visitors will be from several international countries but I belive introducing them to local Russian cuisine would be a nice experience for them. Music act: My opinion about DJ Happy being the music act is somewhat different. DJ Happy is a world-famous music star and has such a reputation which could overshadow the reputation of the ISA. His appearance could distract attention from the event towards the famous star. I believe that selecting a Local Russian Band for the music act would show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. After all, we want to make our new members welcomed and celebrate our newly established subsidiary. Presentation Tasks: I agree that it is a good plan that we both do the presentation tasks. Thank your for your willingness to leave the awarding part up to me. However, I think it is in our both interest if I do the opening speech because I cooperated with many business contacts of ISA and therefore I think they would be happy to see a familiar face during the opening ceremony. Sponsor Selection: Maybe you are forgetting that Boomerang also made a very good offer and an opportunity to sign a long-term contract which would ensure sponsoring future events of ISA. We cannot only think about the short-term stability of our Association, but also think about the future. Looking forward to your answer. Best regards, Chris
"Dear Chris, thanks for your answer.  Great to hear that wk3 fits to your schedule - I think we found with this date a good agreement. However, for the other points I cannot comply with your proposal. Herewith my suggestion Catering A local russian cuisine is something which I cannot comply with. Iam fully convinced that an international event requires an international buffet. My earlier experiences with this kind of events showed me, that local food isnt in the wish of intl' vistors. If you agree on this, I am willing to leave the opening speech up to you, and takeover the awarding like you suggested. Sponsor selection. Yes, you're right that boomerang made a pretty good offer. But Art Inc. made the best total offer and we've made always good experiences with this company. I think its important to appreciate this by accepting them to be our main sponsor. I therefore suggest to stay with Art Inc. If you are willing to go with Art Inc, I could image to go with another Pop Band instead of DJ Happy. Even if I think, DJ Happy would be the best band for the party ;). Regards, Alex."
"Dear Alex, Thank you for your answer. There are still some issues I have about your proposal. Catering: I have to tell you, an international buffet is not an option for me; especially now when we are expecting so many important people at the event who expect a certain level of formality. Music: If you do not agree on choosing a local russian band for the music act, and want to go with pop band FreeLife, then there is only one way to incorporate the russian culture in the event and that is with the food. In that case, I can agree on choosing the band FreeLife. Sponsoring: When it comes to sponsoring, I have some fears choosing a sponser who is not willing to sign a long-term contract, even after so much succesful cooperation between us. They can always decide to change their mind. By choosing Boomerang, we are playing it safe in the long run which I think will also be an imporant issue when ISA members will be choosing the winning team. Please take it into consideration. I am sending you my offer and am looking forward to your answer, Best regards"
Dear Chris, thanks for your answer. Following proposal from my side: The international buffet is important for me as well. Although I think, Art Inc will be the best sponsor - under the condition to leave the other points as agreed, I will accept to go with the sponsor boomerang if you agree on the international buffet. Think this is a good compromise. Thanks. Rgds, Marc
Dear Chris, I can meet you half way and go with the Inernational buffet if it is so important to you, only if we then choose a local Russian band for the music act and by that way welcome our new subsidiary to the Association. Looking forward to your answer, Alex
Dear Chris, if we choose the international buffet, I can agree on the local russian band. However, if we now choose Boomerang as our main sponsor - I would like to thank ArtInc for the support of the last years in the opening speech. I therefore prefer to switch the presentation act, so that I start with the opening speech, followed by the awarding of you. Hope thats fine for you. Looking forward to your answer. Rgds, Alex
Dear Alex, I am happy to accept your offer. Looking forward to the event and seeing you. Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, First, it's nice to get to know you! I'm Alex and I've been a member of the ISA ever since I started with my studies. As you have probably already heard, we will form one team for this years' competition which's theme is the planning of the 40th anniversary. Unfortunately we haven't met before at one of our ISA events. This competition is our chance to stand out and become highly visible throughout the whole organisation. Combining our ideas and knowledge whilst working together as a team, I am convinced that we will win and make the whole event a huge success for the ISA and all of us. So I'm very much looking forward to collaborate with you! Yet, there are still some issues we have to talk about. I believe that our history and where the ISA came from highly contributes to its success and formed the organisation as it is today. For the overall event I envision an international and dynamic atmosphere, which is characteristic for our open-minded organisation. This is a very important event to the ISA and all of us and it's going to be big. Therefore we need to focus on our financing first. Iï¿½m glad that I can tell you that several companies have contacted us and that they are willing to sponsor our event! Taking several facts into consideration I concluded that it would be the best to choose Art Inc. as they made the best offer for the event. In addition, we already maintain a good relationship with Art Inc. which should be considered as well. From my point of view the best Date of Conference is in week three, as in week 1 and 2 the event would collide with the most important business conference in Russia and other personal dates of some higher ranked members of the ISA. These are some first suggestions of mine. I am very interested in getting to know your ideas and your vision for the event. Best regards, Alex
Dear Alex, Itï¿½s nice to finally get to know you! I heard a lot of positive things about you and Iï¿½m looking forward to work with you. I think we got a rare opportunity to not only represent the ISA with a great event but also show that we can work as a team. I have read your suggestions on the date and the sponsoring. I agree with you that the third week is our best choice. Week 4 and 5 would be already too close to Christmas. Financing the event is of course a very important issue, but I think we have to consider Boomerang as well. Itï¿½s true that Art Inc. would spend a little bit more money on the event itself, but Boomerang offered a long-term contract. With this sponsoring partnership we could financially secure many future ISA events. For the event itself I imagen an event suitable to the Russian culture. In my opinion itï¿½s important that we show our guest that we have interest in their culture. I think the easiest way to do that is to have some local food and music. Best regards,   Chris 
Dear Chris, It is good to hear that you also see the great opportunities implied in the competition and that you are as motivated as I am to carry it out as a team. I am glad that you agree on my suggestion on the Date. So we can already settle the Date of the Conference in Week 3. I have read your remark on the Sponsor Selection and I do agree that Boomerang might be taken into consideration. However I believe, that we should consider that Art Inc. have supported ISA for a long time and they will surely continue to do so unless we give them a really good reason not to. Violating the business relationship with Art Inc. by selecting one of their direct competitors over them - which Boomerang clearly is- might imply severe negative long-lasting consequences for ISA. I believe that this is an important issue which needs to be thought about carefully. Maintaining good long-term relationships is clearly more beneficial and we should consider that our decision will affect the relationship to our business partners. I also do believe that it is important to show respect to our host country. Yet we shouldn't forget that we are an international students organisation and therefore we should put our clients base - which are the students coming from all over the world - in the focus of the event. We have to meet the needs of the students as they are the future talents ISA is looking for. For the catering I suggest to offer an international buffet, as this highly helps to facilitate networking. Moreover we should offer a greater variety of food, as some people have specific wishes or food allergies. Offering a mixed buffet, where typical Russian dishes and some specialities will be included as well, will ensure that everybody is able to find something they like. I honestly don't believe that a local band will be able to create the dynamic and relaxed atmosphere needed for such a big event. In order to create an atmosphere in which everybody feels comfortable and wants to network, the music should appeal to all the people. As they have different backgrounds and cultures I don't think they will feel comfortable with such a specific music.  An international DJ, such as DJ Happy, will be more able to meet the taste in music of different people and is more likely to adapt to music requests from the crowd. In total I am convinced that it is best to show our new Russian partners the international spirit and open-minded culture that made ISA this big. As it is our 40th anniversary we shouldn't forget about appreciating the international background that we have and our roots. Please let me know what you think about my remarks. Best regards,   Alex
Dear Alex, You are right Art Inc. have supported ISA for quite a while now, but they never offered a real contract. With Boomerang we could really get a partner for the further expansion of the ISA network. Also I think you see it a bit too negative. I donï¿½t think it will hurt our relationship with Art Inc. if we pick somebody else. In fact I even would say it can be a good thing for us. Art Inc. always felt like we depend on them and thatï¿½s why the offered us a real contract. If we pick another sponsor this time they might see we have other opportunities too. About the catering: No, of course you are right our client base are the students which are coming from all over the world. But here is the thing, students who are participating in the ISA network already have the international spirt. Thatï¿½s the reason they joined the organization. They wanted to learn something new and get in touch with a new culture. A buffet might sound nice at the start, but honestly it can never keep up with the quality standard of a course meal. A buffet would be a nice choice if we are talking about a regular ISA event, but this should be something special. Also many important business people will be there and I think they expect a certain level of quality. For the music you suggested that we book DJ Happy and I have to say I really like this guy. His music is very good. But thatï¿½s also a big concern for me. He is really popular and Iï¿½m worried that he could steel us the show. Music is nice and all that, but the concert shouldnï¿½t be the main reason people come to the event. Also artists like him play just for the booked show and thatï¿½s is 2h max. Also the show is planned by DJ Happy and we donï¿½t have any saying in it. So I really would doubt the he would adapt to any request form the crowd. Iï¿½m glad that we share the same overall vison although we have some different opinions a certain issues. But I think we will make it work. Please let me know what you think about my suggestions. Best regards,   Chris
Dear Chris, I appreciate that we can discuss about these issues in an open and honest manner and that you share your concerns with me. We are in this competition together as one team and we share the same overall goal, therefore we should be able to rely on each other and combine our ideas in order to find a suitable solution for the both of us. I am very aware of the fact that the future job opportunity is a big deal and I'm afraid it might influence our teamwork. So here's a thing: I actually spoke to Dr. Illenschitzï¿½ assistant and he told me that the most important selection criteria is the team performance. Even more importantly he told me chances are good that there are two job positions offered for both of the students of the winning team. Therefore I think we should aim for a good collaboration. I'm sharing this with you because I do trust you and we can both win. The competition shouldn't be within the two of us. Unfortunately I'm in a hurry at the moment as I have another important meeting in half an hour. Therefore I want to apologize in advance that my message might not be that detailed at this point. I understand your concerns about the selection of the sponsor. Even though this is a really important issue for me and I would clearly select Art Inc. because of their better offer and the good relationship we maintained ever since, I would agree on making the compromise. For the music act I have to say, that I am able to understand where your concerns are coming from yet I think you should see it from another perspective: The performance of DJ Happy wouldn't steal us the show, it would support attracting students and function as a speacial highlight. We never had such a famous music act at one of our events and I am convinced it would support the prestige of ISA, in terms of offering so much for the members. As a compromise solution I would suggest another great band: FreeLife. They're not as popular as DJ Happy but they would surely work for creating a good atmosphere. In addition, their performance would be less expensive than the one of DJ Happy and they are more flexible than the local russian band. I seriously don't think we should book a local band. For the catering: I wasn't only talking about the international students but also the russian students, the future talents we want to attract. I don't believe that local russian cuisine will impress them but offering international food on a huge event combined with a famous international band surely will draw their attention. I understand your concerns about the quality of the meal. Of course I agree that we need to maintain a high level of quality, only offering the best. And here is my concern about this: I don't believe that the local russian cuisine will be able to fulfill these standards. As you really seem to be averse to the buffet I am willing to offer booking a three course meal. Thereby, we will clearly be able to meet the high quality standards of the business partner and offer different food so that everybody is able to find something they like. I am convinced that we will manage to find a suitable solution. Best regards, Alex  
Dear Alex, Thank you for sharing that information. I already thought that the overall team performance is the key point to the competition. About our offer: I really appreciate your will to get to a suitable solution for both of us and I see your point that we also need some international spirit in the event. How about we meet in the middle? The music is a key element to the event and I think with the FreeLife band we have got some nice music, which will fit all our needs and establish an international flair. For the catering I still think should bring some Russian culture on the table and order local food. For the overall atmosphere the music is more important and we already got an international band there. So the food could be some new experience for the internarial students and a nice welcome to our new Russian friends. What do you think about my offer?   Best regards,
Dear Chris, I appreciate our good communication throughout the negotiation so far and that you are willing to accept the compromise I offered for some of the issues. I agree with you that FreLife will bring the international spirit and help to create the dynamic atmosphere we should aim  at. Moreover will they attract many new students which will help to find new talents for our organisation. I also see your point with including some of the russian traditions and the culture. Therefore I agree on choosing the local cuisine, which is a considerable concession to me. However, I am not accepting to do the award ceremony whilst you are holding the opening speech. I have put a lot of effort and time in the ISA's organization. As I've already compromised on the other issues and moreover suggested to do so, I demand to hold the opening speech in return. I believe that, as we are one team, you should also accomodate to some of my initial wishes. Overall I really apprechiated our good work so far, and I believe this is a really fair deal for the both of us. I am happy to be seeing you around on some other meeting of the ISA. Please let me know what you think. Best regards,   Alex  
Dear Alex, I wanted to thank you for your good teamwork and your willingness to make compromises. I will accept your offer and let you hold the opening speech. I really liked to work with you and looking forward to a great event. Best regards,   Chris
Hey Chris, howï¿½s it going?     I am writing you this message because we have to start planning the upcoming ISA event! I hope you didnï¿½t forgetï¿½     We should start our discussion with the date of the conference. From my point of view, we need to rule out the last week of December because of the holidays. If we want people to attend the event, this has to be taken under consideration. Christmas time is a bad time to organise such a gathering.  The first week is a bit problematic since there is an important Business conference being held at the same time and weï¿½d like companies to show up at the ISA event. The second week is simply impossible because many high ranked members of the ISA are unavailable. How would feel about the 3rd week, which is in the first half of the month of December?     I would like to stress how important the presentation tasks are to me. I have been preparing for this upcoming event with great interest and I feel confident that I could make a decent opening speech for the ISA. You could present the awards, which would require less of your time but would also help you get noticed from the high ranked members of the ISA.     Regarding the music act of the event, I think we should consider DJ Happy. He has a strong notoriety and could attract many students. Indeed, he is quite famous and usually fills huge venues. This could also help us promote the image of how young and dynamic ISA is.     For the catering, since this will be an international event, a buffet would be the most convenient option. This way, people will be able to find different types of food, which could satisfy their distinct preferences.     Apart from that, the matter regarding the sponsors should be quite easy to resolve. We have been using Art Incï¿½s sponsorship for past events and have always been satisfied with their funding. I believe we should continue to foster this cooperation that could lead to even further stable funding from them.       Let me know what you think and weï¿½ll try to find a common ground!     Cheers   Alex  
Greetings Alex   I am very happy to see that you are showing such a big interest in planning the upcoming ISA event. And no, of course I didnï¿½t forget.   I can see that you have made some very good points about how this event should be carried out, but I do have made some alterations and I hope you will agree with me.   Firstly, you have addressed the date of the conference. I completely agree about ruling out the last week of December. You have made a great point. The first week would also be a bad idea, as well as the second, because of the reasons you stated. In my opinion the best options are the third and fourth week, or in other words, the first part of December. So I think it would be ok to agree with your idea, and set the date of the conference for the third week.   Second, let us discuss the presentation tusks. As you have written, this is a very important aspect of the conference, for both of us. As I see it, the opening speech is a chance to address many important aspects of the future development of ISA. Having such an important part in the conference would have a high impact on our future perspectives in ISA and additionally would look quite good in a CV. But I am willing to compromise and agree for you to make the opening speech and I will present the awards.   The thing that is most important to me is the concept and the atmosphere of the celebration. In my opinion, the success of the ISA has always been partly due to the successful adoption of local culture. And respecting that culture will play a vital part in creating a good relationships with our future business partners in Russia.   Which leads me to my next two point, and those are the catering and the music act. For the catering, I strongly disagree that a buffet is the best option. In my opinion, there needs to be real menu, since we are expecting many important people to attend and there needs to be a certain level of formality. So I would suggest that a local Russian cuisine would best suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests.   And the same goes for the music act. I do agree that DJ Happy is a very famous international music star, but I fear that his reputation will overshadow the reputation of the ISA, distracting attention from the event towards the music act. And as I stated before, maintaining the local culture is of great importance to me, so I would suggest that a local Russian band is the best way to go.   The last issue we need to discuss is the sponsor selection. I agree with you to the point that Art Inc have donated some money for different events. However, without a written contract regarding the future, Art Inc. can always decide to change their intentions. And for that reason, I strongly think that our best option is Boomerang, because besides making a great offer, they have also agreed to sign a long-term contract. And that is not the case with Art Inc. Please take a look at my proposal and give me your opinion. I also hope we can find a common ground.   Best regards   Chris
Hey Chris,     Hope everything is going swell on your side.   Iï¿½m happy to see that we already agree on a few points. Yet, there are still a couple things Iï¿½d like to discuss with you.     Regarding the catering, I strongly believe a buffet is of preference for our event since we want to promote networking amongst the guest. This way, the people present at the event would be able to socialise directly and wouldnï¿½t be restricted to the guests sitting at their table. In addition, from my point of view, one specific type of food simply lacks of diversity. I do understand that local cuisine is important here, but we are also trying to attract people from around the world that surely have different preferences. However, to show my intention of compromising things and going halfway, an international buffet could definitely include Russian specialities, allowing people to discover these types of local specialties, without imposing it.     As I see that the concept and atmosphere of the ISA event is of the utmost importance to you, I would be willing to compromise again and bend to your preference of a Local Russian band to further highlight a Russian atmosphere throughout the whole event.     Iï¿½ve studied your proposition of using Boomerangï¿½s sponsorship and I have to say that Iï¿½m not sure this would be the best option. Art Inc. has made the best offer regarding the direct payment for our event. We should welcome such financial support as we are still trying to expand our organisation.   Furthermore, the fact that we have a long history with Art Inc. is of crucial importance. This is something we learn quickly in business. We should not tarnish this mutual trust. As the Russian often say, ï¿½Trust takes years to build, seconds to break and forever to repairï¿½.     I hope youï¿½ll be pleased with these offers.     Cheers mate and drinks are on me once we get to Saint-Petersburg!       Alex  
Hello Alex I think we are actually very close to come to an agreement, which is great. However, in order to do so, we need to compromise, and I hope the both of us will be able to do that. So in that spirit, and for the benefit of the event, I will agree with you for the sponsor selection. Even though I think the better option would be Boomerang for the reasons I stated in my previous mail, we can go with Art Inc.   But as far as the catering goes, I have to state that the local Russian cuisine is still our best option. I strongly believe that the best and easiest way to show appreciation of the local culture is through the catering and the music act, which means that they should be combined in order to send the prefect message. I hope that you will agree with me. Best regards   Chris
Hey buddy,     We are indeed getting close to an agreement, which is something to be proud of for the both of us!     As I mentioned earlier, I do understand the importance of the Russian ambience for the event. This is why I pointed out the fact that, in the International Buffet, we surely will include Russian meals for our guests. What is of the highest importance for me is the possibility for our guest to mingle and socialize freely during the event without being constrained to their table.   In addition I am willing to let you select the Local Russian band for the music act. This way, our guest will definitely feel the local Slavic atmosphere, I can assure it!     I would be willing to try out Boomerang as our sponsor in order to adjust to your first preference.       I think this is an honest proposal and Iï¿½m afraid this is as far as I can go.       Cheers,       Alex  
Hey Alex Close, very close. But if I am willing to give you the international buffet, and as I can see it is very important to you, you must be willing to give me the presentation privileges. And I am afraid this is as far as I can go. Additionally, another option would be for you to give me the Russian cuisine and the Russian band, and you can choose the other three points. So in other words, I am offering two options.   Best regards   Chris
Hey Chris,     As my last offer was final, I can only come up with the following concessions. I would accept to give you the presentation privileges if weï¿½d go for Art Inc as a sponsor.       Alex  
Hey Alex I can see that we can't make a deal if we dont change things up a bit. So instead of a local Russian cuisine we can have a International three coure meal, and insted od week 3, why dont we try week 4 for the date of the event. Write to me your opinion. Best regards Chris
Hey Chris,       In order to find a common ground, I can accept your proposition of week 4 for the event. However, as I mentioned several times, a formal diner would be quite burdensome and inconvenient for the networking of our guest. The fact that Russian specialties would be included in the Buffet and that you would also select the Local Russian band will certainly create the Russian atmosphere that you are looking for.   In addition, I would be willing to let you do the presentation. I would appreciate it if we chose Art Inc as sponsor for the event in this case.   Alex  
Hi Alex Let us try even a different approach, and a really think it's very fair. Let me maintain the local culture withe the catering, and i will let you have DJ Happy as the music act. For the sponsor selection, let us go with Boomerang for the reasons a stated earlier and you can have the presentation privileges. I hope this offer is good for both of us, because i am really looking for the win-win situation. Cheers   Chris
Hey Chris, I don't think we should just change all the parameters without any logic just to find a agreement. I have revised your past offers and I'd be willing to accept the following. Cheers,   Alex
Hey Alex I am very happy that we were able to find and agreement, even though it was a little hatder than we thought in the beginning :).  Thank you for being a reasonable negotiating partner. Cheers   Chris
Dear Chris,   I am looking forward to a good cooperation! I am sure that we will be a great team and we have a great chance to convince Dr. Illenschitz with our concept of organization for the annual conference of ISA in St. Petersburg.   For this we need to do some open issues. These include the following major points:   -        date of the event   -        music act   -        catering   -        sponsor   -        opening speech   According to our young audience with many students I suggest DJ happy for the musical arrangement. He is very famous and he has much experience with big international events.   What is your opinion referring to the catering selection? In my opinion an international buffet fits for everyone and allows our participants to socialize.   As for every large event it is difficult to find a date that fits everybody. But in our case I think the third week fits best.   With regard to the choice of the sponsor of our event, I suggest Art Inc. because they made the best offer and have a short-term payment model.   The last open point is the opening speech. What are your preferences to do this?       I am looking forward to your feedback on the above,   Kind regards   Alex  
Hi Chris, I am also looking forward to a good cooperation! As Music Act i suggest a local Russian band. DJ Happy is a famous DJ and of course it would be a great act for the students, but i think the DJ will overshadow the ISA and will distract the people from the event towards the music act. So on my opinion the best choice would be a local Russian band, because the focus of the event should be to attract the local Russian companies and people for ISA. This leeds me to the catering. Due to the fact, that we should attract Russians for ISA we should serve the local Russian cuisine. I think they might have some good food for the internationals too. Week 3 as the Date of Conference is okay for me, i think i can take this step towards you. As sponsor for the event i suggest Boomerang. Although they pay a bit lesser than Art Inc, i think they are the best choice for us, because the will sign a long term contract for future events. Art Inc hasn't signed a long term contract and we will not know if they are willing to give a sponsorship for future events. And i think this is an important point, to have a look to future events and how to finance them. My preference for the opening speech is: Speech by me and awards by you.   Kind regards Chris  
Hello Chris,       Thank you for your answer!       I also know the importance to get good contacts to local Russian companies but I am convinced that this should not have such a big impact on the event concept. In the end, ISA is a student organisation, which means that first and foremost, it should cater to its client base. I think that leveraging such an important event for politics is a definite sign of distancing ISA from its roots and motives.   It is my opinion that if we can get students ï¿½ the future talents ï¿½ interested in the ISA, then the Russian business partners will automatically work with the ISA to get easier access to these talents. Consequently, I think that attracting students implicitly means attracting businesses. Furthermore I believe that local cuisine and local music would not justify the ï¿½internationalï¿½ part of the name. But since you are of the opinion that DJ Happy would overshadow the ISA, I think that the not so famous pop band FreeLife would be a good compromise!       This leads me to the choice of the sponsor. To a certain degree I agree with you. Boomerang did also a good offer. But I think we should consider our good relationship with Art Inc. They have supported the ISA for a long time therefore I am sure that their support will continue in the future! In addition Boomerang is a direct competitor of Art Inc. Selecting Boomerang could be a reason for Art Inc. to brake up with our business relationship.       The opening speech is very prestigious and we both know it is the perfect place to leave a lasting impression and additionally it would look quite good in our CV. That is why I am also interested to make the opening speech, but I am willing to leave this part to you when you look me in the above points.       I am looking forward to your feedback on the above.       With kind regards       Alex      
Hi Alex, thank you for your detailed reply. I know we had a good relationship with Art Inc, but i really think we have to take Boomerang for the sponsorhip, because of the long term contract they offered. The amount of money they will give us, is just a little smaller than the money of Art Inc and i think a long term contract will compansate this disadvantage and we can be sure to get a sponsorhip for future events with boomerang. As long as Art Inc haven't signed any long term contract, they can let us fall if they want and then we may not have the chance to get a good partner like Boomerang again. As Music Act, i think its allright to book the FreeLife-Band to not annoy the international guests. But i still think it could be wise to serve russain food. I know this is a international student event, but we also celebrate our new subsidiary in Saint Petersburg and we do want to attract Russain companies. And in some way, i think we should take a step towards the Russains and serve the local Russain cuisine. To take a step towards you and to show my good will, it is okay for me to let you do the Speech and i will do the awards. I hope we can come to an agreement! Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris, thank you for your reply. Let us make a final compromise: I can take a step towards you and we take Boomerang and therefor we order the international buffet regarding to our international audience. I hope you agree with that. Kind regards Alex
Hi Alex, thank you for your step towards my idea! But i think it should be at least a international three course meal, because i think there will be many important people who expect a certain level of formality, and the event is also a special event (40. birthday) and a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes.   So i hope we can come to an agreement now!   Kind regards, Chris
Hi Chris,   I can understand your opinion that this 40th anniversary event is a very important one but I am convinced that the converence should have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances which requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. Having a very formal three course meal where everybody sits down for several hours with the same people goes completely against that idea. Having a buffet during which you would be free to move around and talk while eating would be much more relaxed! Furthermore, an international buffet does not exclude Russian cuisine but rather gives the possibility instead of a three course meal or a local cuisine to suit all tastes of the guests. Consequently the international buffet is the best solution to satisfy the wishes of our potential business partners as well as of our international guests. I hope we can come to an agreement now! Kind regards, Alex
Hi Alex, i can not accept your offer. I think it should not be to relaxed on such a special event. There will be many important people who expect this level of formality and i do not want to annoy them. And to the international point: The three course meal is also an international meal, so i think, there will be food for everyone! To be fair, i will let you do the speech. But i can not go any lower than this offer! Kind regards, Chris
"Hi Chris, why do you think that the ""VIP"" expect this level of formality which you described? As I already mentioned in detail, primarily we have to focus on the students as the base of ISA! I did several steps towards you in terms of the music act, the sponsor and also I offered the opening speech to you. I think it is just fair when you take a step towards me referring to the catering! In this context I have to emphasize that it is important to work as a team and to demonstrate our willingness to compromise if we want to convince Dr Illenschitz. I hope you can agree this last offer. Kind regards Alex  "
Hi Alex, i still think it should be a three course meal but therefor i will come back towards you with dj happy. would this be a compromise? I think this will be fair offer! kind regards Chris
Hi Chris, okey I agree if I take the opening speech! I think now it is a fair compromise! Kind regards, Alex
Hi Alex, I accept. Kind regards Chris
Hey Chris,   as the 40th anniversary together with the new celebration of the newly established subsidiary in Staint Petersburg will be a very important event for the ISA - especially after the failed attempt to establish an office in Moscow 2004 - we should start to think about how we could make this event a success.   I have noted several points regarding the key components of the event with some proposals and short explanations regarding them.   First of all I think that we should discuss the Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.. My suggestion is Art Inc. because they have made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event and have supported the ISA for a long time. I think that at an event that important both the good relationship in the past should be honored as well as the (hopefully) good relationship in the future should be promoted by giving them some publicity.   With this kind of support we could afford making some extravagant arrangements regarding the Catering: International buffet or Music Act: DJ Happy . Concerning the latter one I thought about DJ Happy. As he is an international famous performer he would be the appropriate act for an event that big. He also attracts many guests and particularly the kind of dynamic people the ISA is looking for. When it comes to the catering I would suggest an international buffet. The advantages of that choice are the the relaxed and easy-going atmosphere and that at such a multi-cultural event everybody would be able to find something he likes.   Regarding the Date of Conference: Week 3 of the event, the CEO of ISA gave us a timeframe of five weeks, as you surely know. I propose the second week of December. When we would do it in the last week of November, it would collide with the International Converence on Economics and Business Management event in moscow. If we would do it in the first week of December some ISAï¿½s higher rankged members are not able to join the anniversary. If we would do it in the last two weeks of December I think it would be hard to find an appropriate date because of the Christmas holidays.   As you know we also have the opportunity to organise the opening ceremony of the event. This goes along with some Presentation Tasks: Third person.I thought about hiring an external speaker because having someone important talking about the meaning of the ISA for the business world would be beneficial for the association.   Let me know about your thoughts concerning my suggestions. Iï¿½m looking forward to work with you!   Greetings Alex
Dear Alex, thank you very much for your first offer. I'm sure we will find a solution for our remaining issues. First of all I would agree on the  Date of Conference: Week 3 , which is perfect for me too. As we - ISA - are opening a new subsidiary in Russia, the conference will attract many Russian companies, public figures and other business people. Therefore I think our event should reflect some cultural aspects from our future business partners in Russia. In my opinion, the easiest way to realise this is   Catering: local Russian cuisine   and Music Act: Music Act: Local Russian band  . Furthermore I would suggest to choose  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  , as Boomerang made a very good offer too. We would get only slightly less money then from Art Inc. for our conference. However they are interested in signing a long-term contract, which means ISA would profit more from a long-term perspective when choosing Boomerang. Hiring a third person for the presentation task would be counterproductive for our own involvement. I suggest Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris . However I'm also fine with holding the speech on my own and you giving the awards.  I'm sure we will find a good agreement creating a grandiose event. I'm looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerly   Chris
Dear Chris, thanks for your response. Iï¿½m glad to hear that we can agree on the Date of Conference: Week 3. I understand that as the ISA is opening a new subisdiary in Russia, the event will attracht a lot of russian companies, busienss figutes etc. But because of the international orientation of the ISA and the fact, that not everybody at the event will be russian and therefore familiar with the Russian cuisine I propose that we should consider having a Catering: International three course meal  just to make sure that the guests get the food they like. The same for the music act. Because of the fact, that this event will primary be the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the International Student Association, I think that the music act shall also be rather international oriented. What do you think about Music Act: FreeLife? Concerning the sponsor, I understand your point of having the benefit of a having a long-term contract with Boomerang. Nevertheless we should consider that Art Inc. has supported the ISA a long time and Iï¿½m sure that their support will continue in the future unless we will give them a reason for them not to do that. Such a reason could be selecting Boomerang as sponsor as they are dircet competitors to each other. I think we should think about the consequences and postpone the decision to a futere date. Sponsor Selection: No Selection   Regarding the presentation tasks I agree with your suggestion Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris. Looking forward to your thoughts. Kind Regards, Alex
Dear Alex, I agree that not everyone might be familiar with Russian cuisine or likes Russian cuisine and would accept your proposal for Catering: International three course meal . However, to include some russian elements I would still prefer the Music Act: Local Russian band , which would help ISA to establish a good relationships with the different companies and officials. Keeping in mind the concession  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris , I'd still suggest Boomerang as our main sponsor. The contract for Sponsor Selection: Boomerang would ensure financial security of our organisation for a very long time.  At least we seem to agree, that the other two sponsors (Corporate Ltd. and Documenta) are not suitable for ISA. Finally I think we're on a good way finding a solution. I'm looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerly Chris
Dear Chris, Iï¿½m glad that we can agree on the Catering: International three course meal and on the Date of Conference: Week 3  so far. Nevertheless I still think that because of the international orientation of the event and the 40th anniversary of the organisation - the I in the ISA renownedly stands for INTERNATIONAL :) - an international Act like DJ Happy would be the appropriate choice. If we could make the Music Act: DJ Happy  I would approach towards you let make the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  your way and also accepting Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  - although I still have some stomachaches because of the latter one. I also think that we soon will find a feasible solution for both of us! Kind Regards, Alex 
Dear Alex, I'm glad we could agree on nearly all issues. I have only one minor request: I think that DJ Happy would distract the attention of our event towards the music act. In other words: I think many people would come here to see DJ Happy and the ISA-event would only be a side-act. Since DJ Happy and FreeLife are both more attractive for the younger generation than the local russian band, I would prefer  Music Act: FreeLife , which should be suitable for all guests. I'm looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerly Chris
Dear Chris, I can understand your concerns about people only coming for DJ Happy but I donï¿½t see any negative aspects of it. The more people come to the event the more probably it will be finding the right talents the ISA is searching for. I also donï¿½t think that the ISA-event will be a side-act as it depends on the concrete proecudre of the event. As we donï¿½t have a concrete procedure yet I think that it is only a concern about a possible consequence than a fact.  If you feel better about Music Act: FreeLife anyway Iï¿½m sure we can handle this. My suggestion for a compromise would be that we handle the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris this way and please keep in mind that I approached you concerning the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang. Iï¿½m eager to hear your suggestions. Kind Regards,  
Dear Alex, thank you very much for your last offer. However I think this solution suits more my personal preferences. In my opinion we found a good solution and I'm looking forward to see you at the latest at our event. Thank you for this fair and open negotiation. Yours sincerly Chris
Dear Chris, I am writing you regarding the conference and 40th anniversary of ISA. Although I didnï¿½t meet you jet, I am lucky to have such an experienced partner. Your connections to the business partners of the ISA combined with my experience of planning events could be very helpful for us to win this challenge. As this is a team competition, I think the only way to dominate is by being honest to each other and concentrate on the main goal - to reach a good overall result. So, enclosed I sent you a possible solution how to plan the event. Since this is an event with guests from all over the world, I thought it would be useful to have an Catering: International buffet  so that everyone gets replete. About the date of the conference. Since in the second week the ISAï¿½s vice president are unavailable it would be inconsiderate to set the event up to this date by knowing they cannot take part. Additionally they are probably the ones who evaluate the event so it would be bad for winning the competition. Week four and five is right around Christmas so I think the best opinion would be Date of Conference: Week 3 . As I already mentioned this is an international event so a famous act like Music Act: DJ Happy  would be pretty good. With this act we can reach most young people especially the students which are the focus of ISA. About the presentation, I think the speaker should be from ISA, because an outstanding person telling something about an organization he isnï¿½t part of seems peculiar to me. Since I have already organized a lot of other events I think I could surrender the awards up to you Chris. I would then in return hold the greeting. To the sponsor selection I can say, that Art Inc. is a long-time sponsor of ours. Thus Boomerang said that they will maybe sign a long-term contract their offer is slightly less which means less money for our event. Additional accepting Boomerangs offer could disgruntle Art Inc. which should not be an opinion since their support should continue in the future. I think Corporate Ltd. and Documenta are not an opinion since their offers are very low in comparison to the ones of the others. Therefore  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  would be my choice.     All in all I think this could be a great possibility to set up the event. I am looking forward to hear your opinion about the conference and the 40th anniversary of ISA. Thanking you in advance for your response. Yours sincerely, Alex.
"Dear Alex, Thank you for your email. Like you, I am also very pleased to have such a skillfull partner. Your event plannings were always very successful, and I am confident that the combination of our skills will lead us to victory. So I have to disagree with you statement 'to reach a good overall result'...Alex, to dominate the other teams and win the contest, we will have to focus on reaching the best result ;-) Having that said, I have read your proposal and I think that it is a nice start. However, to really impress the contest judges and the business partners, I believe that the concept that you have proposed is not unique and inspiring enough to make a longlasting astonishing impression that will lead us to victory. The success of the ISA in establishing new offices has always been to a great extent due to the successful adoption of the country's local culture. This is important considering that this is a vital part of creating a good, longlasting relationship between ISA and its business partners in Russia (and even more importantly considering ISA was unsuccesful in Russia in the past). Thus, we need to show ISA's appreciation for the local (Russian) culture. To do so, we should focus the catering on Catering: local Russian cuisine and create an even more lively athmosphere by inviting Music Act: Local Russian band  . Trust me, both the contest judges and the local business people will greatly appreciate ISA's respect towards the russian cultulre if the conference's catering and music reflect local culture and tradition. This brings me to the date of the conference and sponsor selection. I highly agree with you that the best Date of Conference is Week 3 . This way, the higher ranked members of ISA can attend the conference which I think is very important considering it's ISA's 40th anniversaty (and they are probably the people evaluating the concepts, thus incerasing our chances to win the contest). Reagerding the sponsor selection, I know that Art Inc. proposed quite the good offer, but I am really concerned about their long-term intentions as they are not willing to sign a long-term contract. I know that Art Inc. has been sponsoring some ISA events, but ISA's relationship with Art Inc. really lacks a stable and secure future.  Boomerang, however, has ensured the sponsoring of future events of the ISA by signing a long-term contract. And such a contract provides financial security for several upcoming ISA events, and even to some extent for the ISA itself. The more ISA grows, the more important a secure and rock solid stable future becomes. Yes, Boomerang's offer is slightly lower than Art Inc.'s offer, but it simply provides more stability and continuity, both aspects that are very important to ISA's future. Therefore, i see it in ISA's best interest to have Boomerang as a sponsor  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  . Lastly, I also agree with you on the presentation task, in that this should not be done by an outsider. I do think that it would be better from a PR perspective that we turn around your suggestion and that I do the speech and you hand our the awards. Being the face of ISA to their business partners, I think that it is strategically better to let me do the opening speech Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex . As I am the person who has established the relationship between ISA and the business partners, I think that they would pleasantly appreciate it if a person that they already know introduces the future plans of ISA (and thus the future relationship with ISA's partner).  Alex, I am extremely confident about winning this contest with this concept. And just as important, this concept will impress the contest judges by its uniqueness and focus on making ISA stand out during the conference as the world's best international student association. Have a nice day and I am looking forward to your respone. Best, Chris      "
Dear Chris,   First, I will thank you for illustrating your opinion. For coming to an agreement, I have several suggestions: I could accept the Date of Conference: Week 3 , but the Local Russian band and the local Russian cuisine is not an opinion for me. Therefore, if we would take the Catering: International buffet  and something else than the local Russian band I could accept doing the awards and in return you could hold the speech. Additionally I would prefer Art Inc. as a sponsor but to come to a good conclusion I could accept Boomerang, depending on whether we came to an agreement about the other points. I am looking forward to hear your opinion about my suggestions and hope that we can find a compromise that both of us can accept. Kind regards, Alex.
Dear Alex, My apologies for keep you waiting so long. I really needed the time to think about your suggestions and figure out how that would affect our concept for the contest. I'm sorry, I am just so stoked about winning this contest that I sometimes lose track of time! Anyway, we still have about one day and I am still positive that we can pull this off. So far, I really like your honesty and openness, so thank you for that Alex. So, lets discuss your suggestions. I can imagine that you are hesitant about the catering if it will be a local russian cuisine. Question is if people will enjoy the local dishes like Beef Stroganoff, Okroshka or Pashka. Though you have got to admit that this is a unique selling point in our concept. I bet that probably no other group will choose this catering, playing it too safe and not impressing the judges by making a somewhat risky but less 'common' move. But after giving it a long thought, I am willing make another suggestion, which is  Catering: International three course meal  . To be very honest, I really dislike a buffet and I am very sorry that I just can't agree with an international buffet. It just sounds so g*d d*mn cheap (sorry for my language) and on top of that I have very bad experiences with buffets in the past. It's just not impressive and doesn't fit ISA's 40th anniversary. But I am willing to accept an international 3 course meal. A 3 course meal at least signals some status (which ISA desevers and should communicate to the others). Should I accept an international 3 course meal, I do however propose to still stick to the  Music Act: Local Russian band  . That is, I can image that a local cuisine as well as music is a bit too much, but no local music as well as catering is not going to cut it for me. I really want to signal ISA's respect towards the russians. ISA failed to establish a connection with the russians in the past and we therefore really need to make sure that ISA succeeds now. Knowing the russians, they highly respect a 'comrade' kind of relationship and showing at least some respect (either local cuisine or music) is the least we must do. Eagerly waiting to hear your respons to these suggestions. Again, with little left than 1 day on the clock, I am sure that we can work things out....and I am even positive that we are the winning team (call it a gut feeling). Cheers, Chris  
Dear Chris, No problem, I think we will find a conclusion, too. I think your arguments lack since a buffet is standard for business conferences and how will you serve the russian cuisine? You have to serve it in a buffet, too unless you will let your guests choose between several meals. I think arguing is not a way to reach our goal because both of our positions have their pros and cons. Nevertheless we should really start dabating instead of telling each other how we would like to have the conference. Hereï¿½s my offer: I think we agreet about week three yet. For the sponsor I will accept your favourite Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  . For the presentation task I also came towards your offer and could accept that you hold the speech and I do the awardy. In countermove, we could have the International Buffet. And for tha last music I will accept tha local russian band. This is like my last offer where I leaved the music act up to you. If there is really no opinion for you to have the international buffet and take the three course meal, we have to take DJ Happy insted of the local russian band. But additionally I think I would want to hold the speech than, since catering is a really important point for me. If you can not agree with some points, we sould maybe renegotiate about the sponsor selection. But I first would like to hear your opinion about my second offer, since we maybe find a solution by working on this. Kind regards, Alex.
"Good morning Alex, You're absolutely right, everything has it's pros and cons. But saying that my arguments lack ""since a buffet is standard for business conferences"" clearly shows that you're missing the point. I don't consider ISA's 40th anniversary as just a business conference. It's a very special occassion. That's why I consider the catering (like you do too) and music so important. It has to be special, not like a regular business conference. And it has to mean something. About the russian cuisine, I have a 3 course meal in mind where guests can choose between 3 starters, 3 main courses and 3 desserts - to make sure that people who are vegetarian, or people who don't like fish or whatever have an option to choose something different (and this type of 3 course meal is always used at anniversaries/special occassions).  Obviously, we both consider the catering as very important. So, about your offer: Setting the date of the conference to week 3 is what we both agree on indeed I am happy that you can agree on the sponsor selection and that you are willing to let me do the speech during the conference presentation and you do the award. So, the music act and catering are all that is left to negotiate about. You offered to accept the local russian band if I am willing to accept the international buffet. So, to recap it quickly and to make sure that I understood it correctly, the following package compises your final offer: Date of Conference: Week 3   Catering: International buffet   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Well, to be honest I am really hesitant to give in on the international buffet...but I am willing to accept the international buffet in return for the local russion music band. So Alex, do we have a deal? Cheers, Chris    "
Dear Chris, I think after letting you choose the music act, the presentation task and the sponsor it would not be fair if we start to discuss about the catering which is my only first choice. Nevertheless I accept and hope our collaboration will be better in the future. Kind regards, Alex.
"Good Morning Chris,   hope you are doing well. Thank you, that we can discuss our final points via Negoisst. Beside you see my offer. Let me briefly say a few words about it.   Presentation Tasks: The rule was that the speech is hold by the organisers (which hopefully we are ;-) ), so I donï¿½t think that a third person should hold the speech, to share the two parts would require a high coordination and the possibility to fail is much higher. We should share the speech and separate the parts. If it is ok for you, I would suggest that you can announce the awards for high impacts to those important people and hand over the awards, so I would hold the speech and introduce the part with handing over the awards.   Sponsor Selection: I heard about your  good work for ISA in cooperating with the business contacts of ISA. So you know how good Art Inc. supported us for a long time at nearly every event for years and also gave us the main part of internships for our members, we shouldnï¿½t annoy them in order to lose this biggest partner by choosing another one. We both know what kind of very good offer they gave to us. So there is no real equal opportunity around.   Date of the Conference: In the first week is the International Conference on Economics and Business Management right in Moscow, ofcourse the companies are able to send another employee to our conference, but it is not an ideal solution. In week 2 there are some of our higher ranked members, e.g. the vice president are unavailable, we should give them the chance to attend the annual conference of ISA ofcourse. Beside that, they will rank our organization plans, I guess it is clear that we should consider that. In week 5 is Christmas and week4 as we all know a busy week right before Christmas. All in all I think week 3 is the best option.   Music Act: I think on this international association`s meeting we should show our international orientation and choose an international famous actor like DJ Happy. His presence or  the very fact, that we will announce him, will attract many guests.  Of course concerning the opening of the Russian office we could choose a local Russian band, but I think we go along with each other when considering that it is also the 40th anniversary of ISA.   Last but not least, we should decide concerning the Catering: As I said before we shall take into account that this is a mixture of Russian office opening and ofcourse the important 40th anniversary of ISA. For the food we should take into account the international guests with different  taste. Concerning having a three course meal with sitting next to the same people over hours, it would better fit to have a buffet, so the guests could socialize and establish new contacts, which is one aim of the ISA as we know. In addition, an increasing number of large management meetings are designed in the form of a buffet , so exactly this aspect can be considered that you get to know more people . And as a student organization we should still follow the modern approaches of management.     Looking forward to your answer and opinion, Yours, Alex"
"Good Morning Alex, I am doing very well, thank you. Did you have a nice weekend? Thank you very much for starting the discussion in Negoisst. While viewing your offer, I could certainly see that you gave it some serious consideration. Hereby I offer you my thoughts and I hope we can come to an agreement. I know that you also want to make this the best conference ISA ever had. Presentation Tasks: Indeed, bearing the high coordination in mind, I certainly agree that we should not hand over the presentation task to a third person. I also gave it quite some thought about dividing the two task and I came up with the following. Although it would be quite an honor to hand over the awards to the most important people present, I think we should divide the task differently so that we can make use of each our qualities. Hence, although I do not doubt the fact that you would do your utmost best, I would really appreciate it if we could switch tasks so that I could hold the opening speech. Being a part of ISA (in the context of student internships at ISA's business partners) for more than five years, I think I could contribute the most to the opening speech by making use of my profound knowledge about ISA, these business contacts and their (future) interest. Therefore, would you do the honors of handing over the awards? Sponsor Selection: True, Art Inc. has supported us for a long time now and I know that they provided us with the best offer. However, Art Inc. did not provide us with a written contract regarding the future like Boomerang did. Therefore, they can always decide to change their intentions. Although Boomerang's offer was slightly less than the offer of Art Inc., they are willing to sign a long-term contract. In this contract, they would ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. Such a contract would provide financial security for several upcoming events and to some extent for the ISA itself. Keeping the small difference in money and the financial security in mind, do you also agree that it would be best to select Boomerang?   Date of the Conference: You have persuaded me to select week 3. I honestly preferred the fourth week, but being that close to Christmas... Hence, I agree with your offer to select the third week :).   Music Act: With regards to the music act (and catering), I had quite some different thoughts. The main reason for this year's celebration being in Russia is for future aspects. We both know that ISA plans to use the event as a leverage to assure a successful start for the new office in Saint Petersburg. This can only be assured by establishing contacts to as many local business people and officials as possible. It would thus definitely pay off to adapt partly to the local culture. In this way, ISA shows the new members and guests that they are important and it would make them feel very appreciated. Since these prospects are needed for a successful start in Russia, it seems smart to adjust some minor factors (such as the music and dinner) to their satisfaction to get the most out of the event and the opportunity. ISA's success has always been partly due to the successful adoption of local culture. This is a vital part of creating a good relationship with our future business partners in Russia. I thus feel that the atmosphere of the event should reflect some local cultural aspects while being a very enjoyable conference for all visitors. Hence, I think it would be for the best to select a local music band. Moreover, if we were to select DJ Happy, then I think that the main event would be quite ""forgotten"". In other words, DJ Happy would then be regarded as the main act and ISA would be just regarded as a side-act. I think this is not what we both want. What is your opinion about this? Catering: Although the social aspect of your offer sounds reasonable, I think that a buffet would not be suited for the 40th anniversary. As we have always made use of a buffet, I think that anything less than a three course meal would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years, which weren't even some special events like this upcoming 40th anniversary. Moreover, we know that there will be many important people present who expect a certain level of formality. Having a buffet would definitely harm the prestige of ISA. Having a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. This leads me to the following, since we know that we have to attract Russian prospects, I think that a local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guest the best. Would you agree with having a local Russian cuisine (three course meal)? I am looking forward to hearing your opinion about this and I really hope we can come up with the best idea for this event. Best regards, Chris"
"Dear Chris,   Yes, it was quite very nice, thank you.   Thank you for your response. I`m very confident, that we will get along in all points and find an agreement, also because we already found one solution out of our last five issues.   Presentation Tasks:   I am so glad that you mentioned to divide tasks according to  each of our qualities. In my last 6 years for ISA I organized some quite very successful events and hold some opening speech. I guess you havenï¿½t taken that into account, so would you mind to go with this solution?   Sponsor Selection:   As I mentioned before your points are quite right. But take in mind, that Art Inc. does not only provide us financial security. Art Inc. gave us more than the half of our internships and they are doing this for a long time without any long term contract. Is it a real good start with a business partner just to cooperate with a long term  contract? Do you think that kind of relationship does fit to a student organization like ISA? If we choose Art Inc. we can secure the next internships and the financial suppot, ALSO Boomerang will keep on trying to convince us, as the main and direct competitor of Art Inc., to choose them for our next event. So when we now choose Art Inc., we can save the support of Art Inc. and Boomerang. Donï¿½t you think that this would be a good agreement?   Concerning the other two issues, what do you think about a compromise? Music Act & Catering:   I understand your point . Surely we must be aware that not only the 40th anniversary plays a significant role , but also the ( re ) opening of the Russian office . However, in respect of music acts , I have the opinion that we do not meet the taste in music of our audience entirely and we have not enough information , what band would be the right here . Therefore, I would differ from my proposal and suggest the pop band FreeLife . Then your fear that ISA only for side -act is calmed , but we can ensure an adequate quality , which is also expected  by our guests.  What do you think? As regards the catering , I 'm a bit puzzled . You have also some successful contacts with various companies. It is always respected to have a buffet and shows the innovative strength and flexibility for what ISA stands . So I think we should agree here on the international buffet , to have a certain selection also in view of the very special Russian cuisine , which would definitely lead to some inconsistencies among our international high ranked guests who are accustomed to . What do you think about that compromise, that I make a concession concerning the Music Act and you concerning the Catering?     So, let us present the best plan, so we can gain the challenge! ;-)   Have good evening Chris, looking forward to your reaction, Alex   P.S.: i hope my offer arises in the right way to you. Because at the moment the percentage does not change ( I will contact the support team of negoisst) when I change the values for the issues."
Dear Alex, Thank you very much for your quick response. I also have the feeling that we will reach a (good) solution in order to gain this event :). I have no idea how the percentages work, though, because mine were not right either the first time round. Okay, let us see if we can find more solutions. Judging from your expertise, I am willing to compromise on several points. Let me start with the Presentation Task first: From what I understood, you were indeed part of organizing successful events, but never an event this big. Therefore, I wanted to help you by offering to hold the opening speech since I have been doing this for quite some time now. I aslo felt that holding the opening speech would be very good for my C.V. (and the job opening), but I guess that you had the same thing in mind? However, we need to cooperate together to make this the best idea for the 40th conference. Otherwise, we won't be able to organize the event at all...and we both will not stand a chance to receiving that job at ISA. Therefore, I am willing to let you hold the opening speech and I will divide the awards after. I trust you can do this. The sponsor selection: I understand your point.. Although I would very much prefer to chose Boomerang to secure ISA's financial state, I am willing to also compromise on this point.. Hence, I agree to let Art Inc. sponsor the event.   However, that still leaves us with the catering and music act. Keeping in mind that we should definitely please our Russian prospects and let our international customers bond with them, I still strongly feel that we should stick with the local Russian cuisine and the local band. Having a buffet will surely not suit the 40th anniversary event and will definitly harm our prestige levels for an event this big. I know from inside information that a three course meal is very much preferred and since ISA has alsways adapted the event to the local culture, I definitely feel that we should have a local Russian cuisine and let a local band play at the venue. I think this is the best way for social bonding and to show our respect and interest for the Russian prospects. Since I compromised on the presentation tasks and sponsor selection, would you please consider my catering and music act options? Looking forward to receiving your reaction. Best, Chris.                  
"Hello Chris,   First of all, thank you very much, that we can cooperate that fast and good via Negoisst. We will be a good team while planning the event ;)   Thank you for your cooperative behavior. Now let me say some words concerning our last two important issues.   I`m trying to find a mixture of my discomfort concerning a completely Russian orientation of this event and your persistent desire to do so. I leave on my favourite DJ Happy and also of the compromise FreeLife. I trust in you and your instinct, hence, I accept the Local Russian Band. Can you inform us about a suitable decision concerning this band?   The catering is a quite important and  difficult decision. The upcoming event mixes the 40th anniversary of ISA and the opening of the new office, an event like this never happened before, so we should distinguish between the upcoming event and some other opening events for other offices. So, Iï¿½m willing to accept, that we go for a three course meal. But when our orientation concerning the music act is Russian, we should keep in mind the just mentioned aspect, that we should distinguish to other events in the past. Also we show our respect and interest for the Russian prospects. Keep in mind my aforementioned aspect concerning the  very special taste of the Russian cuisine.   Can we come to an agreement with this offer?   Have good evening, Yours, Alex"
Hi Alex, I think we might have a deal here. Let's make this the best event ever! Best, Chris
Hello Chris, my name is Alex and I am also a member of the ISA. I have already some experiences in planning and organising events for the ISA which were always very successful. Iï¿½m very glad to meet you and work with you. I am sure that we can achieve a great result and win the competition. The long tradition of the ISA impresses me and therefore I want to contribute any possible to a successful anniversary event.  Attached you find my ideas for planning the event: Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.     I am looking forward to hear from you! Best regards, Alex  
Dear Alex, I'm a member of the ISA student network as well. Over the years I specialised myself on helping students by finding internships in different companies. The results for me by doing this are a wide network within companies and the knowledge how to work with companies on a wide range of cultures and habits. I'm sure that when we will put our strenghts together we will come up with a succesful idea for the upcoming anniversary event. Attached you can find my ideas about the planning for the event. Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 4   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Third person   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   I'm Looking forward to hear from you. Best regards Chris
Hey Chris, thank you for you message. I appreciate your work for the ISA and I share your opinion that we will can create a successful idea for the upcoming anniversary event by putting our strengths together. I also wanted to thank you for sharing your ideas. But my opinion differs on crucial points, I therefore would like to discuss some points with you. Our common aim should be the celebration oft he 40th anniversary as well as the newly established subsidiary in Saint Petersburg while we should not neglect our roots and the major strength of our association: the students. I completely understand why you tend to choose Boomerang as sponsor. As you know if you have participated in previous events, Art. Inc. has supported the ISA for a long time and we were always happy with them! There is a mutual trust and this kind of relationship is very valuable. They will support us also in the future because they were also very happy with us. In my opinion it would be a big mistake to destroy this mutual trust by choosing Boomerang which is a direct competitor of Art Inc. I am sure that they wouldnï¿½t support us again in the future. Therefore, we should strengthen our relationship and choose Art Inc. as sponsor in any case. This kind of relationship is a priceless advantage for ISA!  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Moreover, we have to discuss the date of the conference. I am aware of the fact that there will never be a perfect date. Week four is very close to the Christmas holidays. Many potential business partners could be on a company Christmas party and therefore couldnï¿½t come to our event. What do you think? Date of Conference: Week 4     Another important point is the music act. Over the last years, there was an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts. The international orientation of ISA couldnï¿½t better be expressed by a famous international act of DJ Happy. He is a very famous performer who regularly fills huge venues with his events. His presence will attract our guests! Music Act: DJ Happy   Additionally, we have to discuss the choice of the catering. Such an event is a great opportunity to get in contact with potential business partners. That should be in our common interest, isnï¿½t it? My experiences have shown that it is much easier to get in contact with other people with the right choice of catering. Therefore, I can highly recommend to choose a buffet. We should create an easy-going atmosphere where people can be connected in an easy way. A buffet is an optimal solution for that. We should seize this opportunity of getting so easy in contact with business partners! Catering: International buffet    The opening ceremony could be the perfect place to reach a broad audience. We both can leave a lasting impression on the business partners. So, in my opinion it is a great opportunity for us to be present at the opening ceremony. What is your opinion? Why do  you tend to choose a third party? Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris I am looking to hear from you. Best regards, Alex
Hii Alex, What you say is true of course. The main targets of this event is to celebrate the anniversary, the subsidiary in Saint Petersburgs and the students. Lets come to an point in what we can combine those three goals and make the best eventplannin out of it. My point on the sponsorship is different. Boormerang is offering us much more secure contract on long therm.The advantage about that is that we will have financial security for even more events in the future of the ISA. Of course I know that we have a good relationship with Art.Inc. but we are an large organisation and we can't base everyting, and especialy not our finances, on trust of a good relationship. Boomerang making us an offer in which we don't have to care anymore about the funding for our events in the futrure. So we definitely have to should for the financial security of ISA and sign the contract with Boomerang. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   For this event we have to include our Russian partners in Saint Petersburg and find new partners in this area. To let them feel fine at this event it is importand to give the event a certaint formality. We could do this by serving the right food. In this case that woud definitely be not a buffet. A buffet would be more suited for internal events but definitely not for a event this big. We will have over some importand gast, we can't give them a buffet. So I would like to prefer the Russian cuisine to give our Russian gast a good feeling and we could learn someting more about there cultrure. Catering: local Russian cuisine   For the music act I will not agree on DJ Happy. The main point of this not to see DJ Happy but is to make new contacts and learn more about our Russian friends. When we hire DJ Happy people whil come because of him and not because of the event. The focus shouldn't be on that, so i would prefer local Russian music.  Music Act: Local Russian band  For the date of the event I could settle on week 3. What do you think about that? Date of Conference: Week 3   For the presenation task I would like to involve a third person. We have a lot to do for organising this event. I we take a third person in to the organisation and let do the speech by him he could completely focus on this task and we on the other stuff that have to be organised. Or do you think that you have enough time to prepare a speech for the event? If thats the point then we can maybe do your offer in which I give the awards and you speech. Presentation Tasks: Third person   So what do you think about this offer? Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris, nice to hear from you. Thank you very much for your offer. I am still happy to work with you and I am still sure that we can win the competition together. Nevertheless I can not accept the conditions that you proposed in your counteroffer. I therefore would like to renegotiate certain issues. First of all, I think that we found an agreement about the Date of Conference. Therefore, we should concentrate us on in future conversations only on the four other issues. As mentioned, I completely understand your argumentation for choosing Boomerang. You are right by saying that a financial security for the next events is important. But nothing is more important than a lifelong relationship. Just think about bad times: Art Inc. will support us always when we need their help. We can ask them in every situation. They will support us again and again. This kind of partner cannot be bought with money!  Of course Boomerang promises to support us in the next events. But think about what happens afterwards? Will they continue? Will they stop it? We donï¿½t know them, and if not, there is no big sponsor, because we have lost Art Inc. and so, ISA would have a huge problem! Additionally, we have to think about our task: our task is to find an idea for the celebration this year! So we have to think about the celebration this year and Art Inc. pays the most. Thatï¿½s another important point why Art Inc. is the best choice. This would increase our chances to win the competition, Chris! As you can interpret my argument, the choice of the right sponsor is the most important issue for me. From the arguments above, there should be chosen Art Inc. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Another very important issue for me is the music act. DJ Happy is the best performer for satisfying our guests. But you are right that many guests can come only because of DJ Happy. My solution for this problem is to not announce him. So, nobody will know that he will come. What do you think? But Chris, we are a team and have to make compromises, I suggest you to choose the Pop band FreeLife. It is not my first option but a compromise for both of us. Music Act: FreeLife   Your argument about the presentation is also right. We have a lot of work for organizing the event. It is also okay when you think that hiring a third party is better to concentrate on other tasks. But my personal situation is very relaxed. I have a lot of free time because I have only once a week to go to the university and donï¿½t do other activities. So, I could prepare the whole speech in my free time and lead the opening speech. I can do this, donï¿½t worry! You have only to give a certificate to some members, this would require no preparation time for you. So, this problem should also be solved perfectly. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Regarding the Catering: we are a student association and therefore, we shouldnï¿½t neglect our major strength:  the students. A very formal dinner doesnï¿½t fit to a student, it would be in conflict with our characterization. Itï¿½s like rolling out a red carpet. You are right that we have to do something especially for our new subsidiary in Russia. With the international buffet, we can focus on Russian food! It doesnï¿½t contradict! We should not forget that we have a lot of other important members and business partners from other countries. Maybe many of these important business partners doensï¿½t like Russian food. We have to take this into account and should offer them something else to not disappoint them! An international buffet with focus on Russian food is the perfect solution. Catering: International buffet   I am looking to hear from you and hope that we found a solution. Best regards, Alex
Hii Alex, Thank you for the next offer. We are already coming closer to an agreement, but there are still a copple of points I can't agree on. The Date of Conference: Week 3  date of the conference is settled than!  First I want to start about the sponsor contract. My opion is stil that the sponsor is that importand that we can't rely on a sponsor bassed on a good relationship and not make up a contract to make it legal. Boomerang is offering us a long time contract for the future. Whitout a written contract regarding the future of the deal between ISA and Art. Inc., this company can always decide to change their intentions and break with the ISA. So what would happen then for our events in the future? Right now we have the option to make a legal deal in which we provide security for events for the coming copple of years! So my oppion is still signing the contract with Boomerang. But I want to make you an offer in which we can get to a compromise. I would agree on the Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  of Art. Inc. That means I would completly give in on the sponsor selection. Besides on this issue I still have the oppioion that involve a third party for taking care of the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  is the best way. But for this point i'm willing to give up this as well so you would take care of the presentation. Summarized, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. We will go on by having as Sponsor Art. Inc. and you can take care of the presenation tasks as well. But since I want to reach a compromise in this negotiation about the event I really want to insist ginving me in excange, for giving up my explained views on Presentation and Sponsoring, the Catering: local Russian cuisine  of the event shoul be local Russian cuisine and the Music Act: Local Russian band  should be insired by the local Russian culture as well. One of the main targets of this event is to come in contact with the local bussineses in Saint Petersburg. We can easely achieve this by doing a music act and catering bases on the local cultures. For the catering we will involve local bussineses so we can start build a link with these companies for future events we will plan in Saint Petersburg. We need those local bussineses for a good start in this region and by involving there culture in to the event we will give them the feeling that we are appriciating them! In my oppion a buffet wouldn't give our partners the feeling that we really appriciate them and the students wouldn't mind to have a nice dinner instead of buffet. Since we have to work togheter I really want to excist on coming to a compromise about the issues we have. We can't have both completely what we want. My oppion is that this is fair deal and make the event to a succes! I'm looking forward to hear from you! Right now I think this is the best sollution for both of us and for the event.  Best regards, Chris    
Hey Chris, thank you for your message. We are coming closer to an agreement and I know, that no one of us can have completely what he wants. But on this point I think that it is necessary to make an alteration in order to find a successful solution. I am happy that you would accept Art Inc. as sponsor. In your argumentation you put this selection together with the presentation task and you want the local cuisine and the local band for exchanging this. In the following I would like to split it. Let me explain it: I also think that the Russian relationship should be part of the event. By choosing Russian food AND Russian music, this would be too much. One could be enough. The selection of the music is also very important for me. But as mentioned, I cannot have completely what I want. So, my suggestion to you is: for compromising the sponsor (Art Inc.) I would accept the Music act (local band). Additionally, I would like to offer you to get the opportunity to lead the opening speech. I know, you mentioned that havenï¿½t a lot of time to prepare it. But, I in my opinion, it is a great chance for you because a lot of important business partners are listening to you. Additionally, it would look quite good in your CV. To solve the problem with the time, I could offer you to help you preparing the speech. For me, it is also okay to give only the certificates. Think about it! The international buffet is too important for the event to exchange it in combination with the music act for the sponsor. We have to work together and this suggestion is a huge concession of me. I think that togehter we cannot achieve a better result than this. I hope you will accept it. Otherwise, I could imagine that it would be very hard to find another solution. I am looking to hear from you. With the best wishes, Alex
Hello Alex, Thanks for your offer! The offers we make each other are already coming closer! I trust in a good compromis at the end of this negotiation! But the offer you made is still not the offer that would be good enoungh for me to agree on. I see that the International buffet is a really importand issue for you. So I'm willing to give you that one, since we both have to make sacrifices to come to a good compromis. But When I give you this one I have to come back on a first offer I made you in which I agreed on Art Inc for the Sponsor selection. I would like to get in retun for giving you the dinner the sponsor contract with Boomerang instead of art. inc. You can also still do the speech. I think that would be a more fare deal. I think if we do it that way we would achieve the best deal for both parties! I'm looking forwar to hearing from you! Best Regards, Alex
Hey Chris, thank you very much for your message and your offer. I am very happy to tell you that we come to an agreement. Togehter we can present a great idea and win the competition. There is the local music act to represent the new subsidiary in Russia, the international buffet to get togehter perfectly and with the sponsor, we have a great financial security for the future. Week 3 is also a very good Date for the conference and I am happy to do the opening speech. They have to love our concept! I would like to thank you for the good cooperation! Best regards, Alex
Dear Chris, As we have already settled some issues for the conference together, I am assured that we will come up with a great concept that suits the special frame conditions. Given the fact that it is not only the annual conference but also ISA's 40th anniversary, we have the opportunity to revive the proceeding. Therefore I think an international music act would be just the right thing to attract energetic and driven people - the kind of guests ISA is looking for. I would suggest to hire DJ Happy. He is very popular, regularly fills huge venues and it is a safe bet that his presence will attract the former mentioned guests.  Music Act: DJ Happy  In order to provide a relaxed atmosphere to support networking among the participants of the conference, a buffet with a mixture of international food would be great. Catering: International buffet   As there is only a timeframe of five weeks, I would suggest to go for the 3rd week to make this intercultural event work. For the opening ceremony I can take the speech part.  Date of Conference: Week 3   An event this big is pretty expensive and Art Inc. has made a generous offer to sponsor the conference. I have to emphasize the great relationship ISA and Art Inc. have developed over the years, so there will be also a future cooperation.  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   I am assured Chris that we will have a successful cooperation and I am looking for your message. Best wishes   Alex
  Hello Alex,   thank you for your message. I am also sure that we will find the best solution for this event.   From my point of view we should keep clearly in mind, that this event is not only the anniversary of the ISA but also the celebration of the newly established regional office in Saint Petersburg. Therefore we should take into account that this event is a crucial possibility to attract new business partners for the ISA and thereby strengthen the relations in Russia. Due to this fact we should also have some cultural aspects of Russia at this event. This will lead to more acceptance among the Russian guests. You can imagine my ideas like a slightly themed event.   One possibility to adapt the culture and thereby to satisfy the Russian guests would be the music act. I really understand that from your point of view DJ Happy is a great idea, but I honestly think that the fame of DJ Happy will push the main focus sidewards, away from the ISA.Therefore we should hire the local Russian band and thus simultaneously adapt some cultural aspects but also focus more on the ISA itself.     Regarding the catering my opinion differs slightly. Many of the guests will be very important people and they will consider a buffet as completely unfitting. A buffet is maybe a good solution for an internal event. If we would have a menu with local Russian cuisine we could even satisfy the important Russian guests. So I would suggest a Russian menu.   Referring to your offer regarding the date of the conference we could (under some conditions) come to an agreement. We can come to a compromise (the third week) if you would agree on changing your mind regarding the sponsor. From my point of view Boomerang would be the optimal sponsor. They made a quiet good offer and they are willing to sign a long term contract. Thereby we would have the commitment of further financial support. So I would make a compromise on the date of conference if you could accept Boomerang as sponsor.   It`s also possible for me to make the speech part at the ceremony. Your message sounds like you do not really want to hold the speech. It would be ok for me to make the speech part and then you can make the part with the awards.     I would be glad if you could arrange with my suggestions.  I`m looking forward to your answer. Have a nice day.   Best wishes Chris
"Hey Chris, thank you for your message. I think we are heading in the right direction. I am well aware of the fact that ISA is not only celebrating the 40th anniversary but also the establishment of the new subsidiary in Saint Petersburg. I truly agree on the fact that this is a great possibility to win over new business partner for ISA. The establishment of an office in Russia offers ISA to continue growing and to stay competitive. I can follow your idea of a themed event and have taken into consideration your ideas on the implementation of such a themed event. I disagree with you that DJ Happy would push away the main focus away from ISA. ISA is run by young people for young people. Having a live act at the conference who is popular among young people all over the world, would consequently cater to the acceptance among the Russian guests. You are right that there will be very important people at the conference, so I am happy to hear that we both agree on the date of the conference, to make sure that the event takes place. As the conference should be a place for networking and getting in touch with new business partners, a formal three course meal will limit these possibilities. Concerning the food itself, I would suggest to offer an international mix to cater to the various cultural preferences. Not everyone might like the local cuisine. Can you imagine to engage yourself in networking while youï¿½re hungry?  ISA needs a promising sponsor who offers a long-term cooperation. Therefore I can see why you propose to start a cooperation with Boomerang. They have indeed made a good offer ï¿½ not as good as Art Inc. but nevertheless a good one. Boomering is a good compromise but I would like to remind you, that ISA has been working with Art Inc. for quite some time now and therefore the cooperation can continue for many more years. They havenï¿½t made for nothing this very generous offer for this event. We shouldnï¿½t forget about the very good relationship we have had so far. Having a new sponsor might put the cooperation with Art Inc. at risk. Concerning the speech part I am motivated to deliver the speech, so I am confident to entertain the audience ;-) I think we will be a great team.   I am looking forward to your answer and wish you a nice evening. Best wishes.   Alex"
Hey Alex, so now we have set two (sponsor and week) of five parts? This is a great way to find a good solution. Like you mentioned the relations with Art Inc. are stable because they exist so long. We shouldn`t worry about disappointing them. From my point of view the focus on the young people is also very important. Such a popular act could be attractive even for the Russian guests. So we could really think about having DJ Happy as music act, under some conditions. Nevertheless we should take into account that the Russian people have a huge national pride. It`s very important for them to see that we adapt some cultural aspects. So if we choose DJ Happy as the music act, we should at least have some cultural aspects regarding the food.  The meal as a menu would have a huge marketing purpose.  And so we could satisfy at least the Russian people. The menu shouldn`t be very extravagant, so that many people would like it. Like you mentioned it`s very difficult to satisfy everyone with the food and maybe some people don`t like the Russian cuisine on the one hand. But maybe the Russian guests would not like the international buffet on the other hand. So we have a very hard trade off at this point. Because of this my suggestion would be to leave the very important cultural aspects aside regarding the music act but then to have the cultural aspects regarding the menu. I furthermore understand your worries about the very formal menu. But with DJ Happy as music act there will be a casual atmosphere which will allow to get in touch also with the very important people. Then we will still have some needed formal aspects for the important people but also in between an informal atmosphere for getting easier in touch with them. What do you think about? This would be a nice compromise I think. Regarding the presentation task I am willing to accept that you take the speech and I take the award part (even the very prestige speech part would also be very fitting for me). Itï¿½s not too bad to have the award part. I really want to find a good solution and a good compromise so that our ideas will be the best! Overall I would accept your favorite music act and the fact that you take the speech if you could arrange with the Russian cuisine. Thank you for your quick answer yesterday evening. It`s great to have such a efficient partner. Best wishes Chris
Hey Chris, it's fun working with you on this great event. It's very beneficial to have different perspectives on planning such an event. I am sure that our concept will leave a great impression. One might think, that we have already planned numerous events of that kind. Great teamwork so far! The date is set, so we have made sure that the overall majority will attend the conference. The awards will be handed out by you and I have already come up with some great ideas for the speech - I might include some opening phrases in Russian :-) As you have mentioned Russian are proud of their country, so making the effort to learn some basic Russian greetings will show great respect. DJ Happy will contribute to the relaxed and energetic atmosphere, so you're right, the Russian will surely like him. Who wouldn't like combing work and fun? The conference will be attended by so many people from different countries. Can you believe that ISA is present in 20 countries?! This development is incredible!  Concerning the catering, a focussed menu on the Russian cuisine will thus provoke difficulties. The Russian cuisine is very special and might be too special for such an international event. I still think that a buffet would be great, but I can see your previous worries concerning the formal aspects of a conference, so a three course meal might be as well a good alternative.  Art Inc. and Boomerang are great sponsors - we are lucky to have such possiblities to choose from. Nevertheless we have to keep in mind that although Boomerang offers a long-term cooperation, getting to such a successful business relationship as we already have developed with Art Inc. takes plenty of time. We are already familiar with the cooperation proceedings, which will facilitate the whole event planning process. Keeping Art Inc. will limit the possible stress factors. Wish you a relaxed evening. Best wishes Alex      
Hey Alex, the idea with the opening phrases in Russian is great! But from my point of view this will not be enough. The importance of establishing the new office is this year very high. Due to the fact that establishing the former office in Moscow had failed in 2004 the success of this office is now crucial to step into the Russian market. Because of this delicate fact we should make some more concessions to the Russian people. If we really donï¿½t want to have the local Russian band, then I have at least to stay at the Russian cuisine. Like you mentioned the ISA is very international, but this does not mean that we have always to serve only the international food. If we would open a bureau in e.g. Japan no one would might if we would serve Sushi. So why not try the Russian one? Maybe your opinion about Russian food is too bad. But if you really think that the Russian food is a nonnegotiable issue, then we could think about having the international three course meal under the condition that we will choose the local Russian band instead of DJ Happy. I really see the need for at least one cultural aspect at this conference. I am very happy that you agree on at least my arguments about the needed formality. The issue about the sponsor is a much less critical topic. I canï¿½t really see the stress factors you mentioned in your last message. They only have to finance the event and give us the banners for the stage. If there will be any problems with the banners I will handle this. So there shouldn`t be any problems if we choose Boomerang as our new sponsor. I really hope that we will find an agreement. Best  wishes   Chris
Hey Chris, making this event work is crucial, because of the failure in 2004. I must admit that I am a huge fan of the Russian cuisine, but nevertheless the food choice is an important aspect that musn't be underestimated. I worry that the local cuisine just might not be met with the enthusiasm we share for this great cuisine. Concerning the live act, we really should go for DJ Happy who will provide an unforgettable framework. He is popular among the guests who will attend the opening of the Russian office. So why settle for a local band, if we both agree, that DJ Happy will provide the most benefit for the overall outcome of the conference. I am really concerned about including this important cultural aspect. So I have made some thoughts about a possible and outstanding implementation. What do you think about inviting a well respected Russian guest - a VIP, who will take over the presentation? The Russian attach importance to such a gesture. Holding the speech would be fun and I have already started to work on that stunning speech but maybe a cultural representative would leave a greater impact on the conference attendants and would show even more respect. The Russian pay attention to the overall atmosphere and impression of such an event - saving money on banners will attract attention but in a negative way. Art Inc. provides the lushest budget. I am excited to receive your message. Best wishes Alex
  Hello Alex,     I have the feeling we are drifting away from our first direction.     If you are against the Russian cuisine then I am willing to agree on the three course menu.     For this agreement I would like to have Boomerang as the sponsor. I thought that the banners will be given to us by the sponsor. We donï¿½t have to print them. The sponsoring company will have also a interests at having a good appearance so they would never save money on the banners and so I think they will have good ones.     I will also agree with you on DJ Happy if you forget the presentation by a VIP. This very prestige task can be the chance to have a huge impression on the very important guests.   Before you let this do another person I will take the speech part and you can have the awards. (I also already started with writing a possible speech before I know that we have to do this task in a team. Because of my preparations before the exact plan I was quiet unwilling to give up the Russian meal and the Russian band.)   So I would gave up my enterprise either to have the Russian meal or the Russian music if you allow me to hold the speech and agree on the sponsor Boomerang.     Maybe this way round we could have an arrangement?     I wish you a nice evening.     Best wishes   Chris  
Good evening Chris, I don't think that we're heading in the wrong direction. It's still about making the most out of this conference and as you have pointed out the importance of a cultural aspect, having an external speaker would provide this. Holding the opening speech would be a prestigious task for both of us, but nevertheless having someone important talking about the importance of the ISA for the business world would definitely leave the most impression. I have received some information from Andy, who is Dr. Illenschitz's personal assistant. We have met at an ISA Christmas party and have kept in touch since that time. Although he isn't allowed to give away important information, he nevertheless has shared an important criteria concerning the job selection. Dr. Illenschitz and his colleagues put the most emphasize to the performance of the team. Therefore Andy hinted at the fact, that in end there might be two job offers. Giving the speech by either you or me would be thus less beneficial, although it would be fun. The sponsor selection is not a very important criteria, so I am rather indifferent about Art.Inc or Boomerang. Wish you a nice evening. Best wishes Alex    
Good Morning Alex,  I knew that the teamwork would be very important so we should both realize our interests. Therefore I am willing to agree that you make the speech part. Even if this would mean to lower the chance to have the best team performance, this is a great possibility to impress some people and so maybe find a job in another company. Also for me there would be then the possibility to impress while handing out the awards.  I am very happy that you are willing to agree on the sponsor. Boomerang is a very good solution.  I would be happy if you would agree on these topics. Best wishes Chris
Good morning Chris, the concept for the conference looks great. I think we can score high for the overall performance. You are right, that letting us do the speech and giving away the awards will also be very prestigious, so that we are able to leave an individual impression and hopefully will get offered a job for either one of us (in case we will win the competition). Looking forward to future teamwork and wish you a nice day! Best wishes Alex  
  Hello Chris,   How are you? I am Alex, your teampartner for the ISA competition. I am very excited to work with you on a concept to plan the anniversary event of ISA. I am a member of ISA since 2009 and I have also planned and organized events which were very successful. Since when are you a member of ISA?  I hope that we will achieve a very good outcome and have an honest and compromising conversation. Donï¿½t hesitate to contact me if you donï¿½t understand my ideas or my point view. To plan this event I think it is very important to choose first of all a Sponsor. In my point of view we should choose Art. Inc., because they made the best offer and have supported ISA for a long time. To maintain the relationship with them we should definitive select Art Inc. as a sponsor. I hope you can agree on that. To lose them as a sponsor would be a disaster. What do you think about when I would do the opening speech and you announce the winners of the award. Would that be ok for you? Otherwise we can also hire a external speaker, in that case we both just have to focus on the procedure of our event and having someone important talking on the event would be also great. For the buffet we should have an international buffet, so that everyone can talk with different people. Because not everybody is familiar with the Russian cusine I think it would be better when we have an international mixture, so everyone can eat what they like. What do you think about these suggestions? Kind regards Alex
Hi Alex, I'm fine thanks, how are you? Unfortunately, I was not able to answer your request yesterday since I had my soccer training. I am also looking forward to work together with you on a concept for the 40th anniversary of ISA at St. Petersburg as well as the establishment of the subsidiary in St. Petersburg - we will rock this competition together! I came to ISA in 2010 as intern and gathered a lot of knowledge about business contacts and their interests.Thank you very much for being open for a honest and compromising conversation - I will do my very best to be able to hand in the best concept of the competition together with you. Since ISA is an international student association to develop leadership skills I would prefer that one of us holds the speech and the other one does the awards. If you want to do the speech, I could go along with it. On the other hand, the conference will not only be to celebrate the 40th anniversary of ISA, but also for celebration for the newly established subsidiary in St. Petersburg and based on my experience as intern I would like to appreciate the stakeholders, especially the representants from companies by providing a local Russian band as well as local Russian food. I would really appreciate to do both, because the former attempt to establish an office in Moscow failed exactly due to lack of networking and preparation and Russians do really appreciate when people show connectivity to their culture. Finally, we have to decide when the conference will take place. Given the Christmas holidays I would propose to take week four, so everyone is able to attend the conference. Your offer concerning the conference program was pretty smart and I can go along with most of them. Thank you very much and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Have a nice day. Kind regards, Chris
"Hi Chris, I am fine, thank you. No problem. Soccer training is also important ;) Good that we agree on the Sponsor. When you think that it is important that we should make the presentation task, I am fine with holding the speech. But we have to talk about the Catering and the Music Act, because I canï¿½t agree with your point of view. It is very important that we donï¿½t forget that ISA is an international Organisation. I know that it is a great accomplishment that we have a new subsidiary in Russia, but we can not only focus on Russian food and Russian music, when we have other important international guests. And when we have an international buffet we will have an atmosphere for networking. Since you said that networking is important, I believe that an international buffet is a good compromise. We canï¿½t forget our other business partners and the students. Not everyone likes Russian food. In addition I do not think that Russian people always want to eat Russian food. A mixture is very important for everyone, especially because it is a multi-cultural event. I understand that you want to appreciate the stakeholder, but in the end ISA is a Student Organisation, which first of all has to attract new talented students.When we have talented students the companies will come voluntarily to ISA, in order to have an easy access to these talents. Thatï¿½s why we should focus on attracting students. Besides that we canï¿½t attract students with a local Russian band. Since over the last years, I noticed an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts, we should be careful which band we hire. Thatï¿½s why I think that it would be great to have a famous international act like Dj Happy. Everyone knows DJ Happy. He is great. We can appreciate the stakeholder in the opening speech and also show them how important this new subsidiary in Russia is for ISA. I think that would be a great solution. Week four is very close to the Christmas holidays. Thatï¿½s why week three would be a better alternative. Or do you see a problem with week three? Have a good evening. Alex"
Hey Alex, I can go along and make a concession concerning the date of the conference, so we will take week 3. Unfortunately, we can not kick out both Russian music as well as Russian cuisine, because we have to appreciate the Russian culture since the conference will be in St. Petersburg. Moreover, during my internship I experienced it by myself how important it is to show this cultural appreciation towards the company's representatives.As a result, I suggest to offer Russian food and to book FreeLife since you don't want Russian music at the conference. I can not agree on DJ Happy since he is a super famous DJ and people would not come because of ISA's 40th anniversary neither because of the new subsidiary. Additionally, I found out that Boomerang's sponsoring offer is only slightly less money than Art Inc's, but they are willing to sign a long-term contract which would lead to a great financial surplus for the new Russian subsidiary as well as the ISA organization, because Art Inc does only invest in this conference for a short-term payment. So I would tend to take Boomerang as sponsor for the conference, what do you think about that? Have a nice evening, too. Best wishes, Chris
Good morning Chris,  Was there a conflict for you concerning the date or why do you write that you can make a concession concerning the date of the conference?  I also thought that it is clear that we take Art Inc. as a Sponsor. Why did you suddenly change your opinion? Boomerang is a direct competitor of Art Inc.. I do not think that it would be smart to choose them over Art Inc., because Art Inc. supported ISA for a long time and they will continue to do that when we keep them happy. When we now give a competitor the chance to be the main sponsor we would show Art Inc. a negative sign. We should strength the relationship with Art Inc. We canï¿½t risk losing such a good relationship. When we lose them as a partner it would be difficult to win them back or even to find a new/equal company. Boomerang did donate less and who knows if they are really going to sign a long term contract.   Alright I understand that it is  important for you to appreciate the Russianculture towards the representatives of the Russian Company. So I will make a concession and accept it when we book a local Russian band.  Could you also be more open for another idea besides Russian food. Donï¿½t forget that this is a multi-cultural event. This event is not only for Russian Companies. It is not our goal to satisfy only Russian Businessman. We also have to attract new students for ISA ,our competitors are getting stronger and we have to keep up with them. We have to promote networking andcreat a  relaxed and easy goingatmosphere, so everyonefeelscomfortable. Whenpeoplecan'teatwhatthey like theywon'tbe in themoodfornetworking. Tolimitthevarietyoffoodwouldhave a huge negative effect.   Have a nice day, Alex
Hi Alex, thank you very much for your concession about the music act - it is really important for me as you noticed. Concerning the date, I meant that I am prepared to accomodate you and select week 3 for the conference - that is what I meant by concession, because I thought week 4 would fit better into the schedule. I see, you want Art Inc. as Sponsor, although the money is only slightly less than the one Boomerang offers. Fortunately, I know the company representative of Boomerang and talked to him and he assured, that they are willing to sign a long-term contract in comparison to the short-term contract of Art Inc. I have a great idea to combine both, althouh they are competitors. Just let me do the opening speech and you will see. So we can go along with Art Inc. as sponsor for the whole conference. Well, I can be more open for catering, since I understand that you point out the multi-culti event - so let us meet in the middle. What about taking the International three course meal, because I can not go along with buffet, since it simply does not fit into such a great event of a 40th anniversary. Moreover, it is even combined with the opening of the new subsidiary, so there will be a lot of important persons and buffet is a way too informal.I hope you can agree on that. Best wishes, Chris  
Hi Chris, Alright so we choose Art Inc. as a partner and you will do the opening speech, but let me know what you are going to say, I am not a big fan of surprises. Is that ok? Concerning the Catering, I do not see a three course meal as a solution, since we both said that networking is very important. When we have a three course meal where everybody sits down for several hours with the same people, there is not a chance to network with different people. A buffet where everyone is free to move around is the best alternative. By choosing a Russian band I did  you a really big favor, I hope you know that.  Chris we should not forget the students. Since we have a Russian band we canï¿½t also have a formal three course meal. The Students should feel comfortable.  Can you agree on that?  You did not give me a good argument why we should not take a buffet as Catering. You should also understand my point of view. I explained you several times, that it is important to attract talented students. We can't just focus on the companies. When you canï¿½t accept an international buffet I will not accept a Russian band anymore. When we have a three course meal and a Russian band we only focus on the companies.I can not go along with that!  When we take a Russian band and an international buffet we would focus on students and on the companies. A different alternative would be to choose the three course meal and Dj Happy. ( I will not accept a three course meal and  Free life).  Since we have to end our negotiation we should decide between these two alternatives. Have a nice evening, Alex  
Hey Alex, so we came to an agreement. Fine! Let's hand in our awesome conference plan and rock this competition. Hopefully, we'll get the chance to organize this conference in reality. Have a nice day and see you soon. Kind regards, Chris
Hey Chris, how are things? I hope you had a great weekend! However, we have to get back to planning this year's conference. Since we already agreed on some issues, other aspects like the music act, sponsor, presentation tasks, catering and finally the date of conference are still unsolved. First, I would suggest to decide about the music act at the conference since the guests seemed to be unhappy with the music acts last year. I have some experience in planning and organising events and in my experience DJ's are always popular on events like this one. Therefore, I suggest DJ Happy, his music is great! You can listen to him on soundcloud. Music Act: DJ Happy   Further, we need to agree on the sponsor, in my opinion Art Inc. made the best offer of all the companies, didn't they? Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Still we need to figure out who is going to present the opening speech and the announcement of the winner at the event. Since I've given some speeches in the past and I always got good feedback, I would suggest that I could give the speech while you could announce this year's winner and hand out the certificate? Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   In addition, we need to settle the catering. I consider an international buffet as the best solution for this multi-cultural event. Buffets are the best solution for events like this one. Catering: International buffet   And lastly we need to agree on a date for the conference. I think week 3 works best. What do you think? Date of Conference: Week 3   So this are the issues we still need to resolve. I'm looking forward hearing from you soon! Best, Alex
  Hey Alex,   I indeed had a great weekend and I am very happy looking forward to the planning of our event. How was your weekend?   I am happy to see that you thought about the missing aspects of our planning. Unfortunately I don't have the same opinion on most aspects.   Wouldn't it be nice to have a local Russian band to show the interest of our organisation in the Russian culture? The main goal of this event is to improve the organisations relationship to the local companies and officials, who would clearly be more impressed by classic Russian music. DJ Happy is more appropriate for a party than a conference. Music Act: Local Russian band   You suggested Art Inc. as the best main sponsor, which is correct if you just consider the direct payment for the event. Boomerang offered to sign a long-term contract, which will not only help for this event but also for future events. This is a great opportunity so I suggest you to think about this opinion. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang     We also should talk about the distribution of the presentation task. I would also like do the speech very much because it is a great platform to present yourself, but you doing it would be okay for me if you can make concessions towards me in the selection of the music act or the catering. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris     Another aspect that we have to talk about is the catering. I think a buffet is a bit informal because a lot of very important people will come to the anniversary. They are not expecting a buffet where they have to wait in line. Furthermore this will harm the prestige of the ISA because it would be a decline in comparison to previous events. The catering is, as well as the music act, also a great opportunity to show our organisations interest in the Russian culture. So I suggest local Russian cuisine or at least a three course meal. Catering: local Russian cuisine     So lastly I have an aspect where I totally agree with you. Week 3 is the best possible date as it isn't interfering with other events and before the beginning of the holidays. Date of Conference: Week 3     Best, Chris  
Hey Chris, my weekend was great too, thanks! I would really prefer an international orientation of the music act, since we will have a lot of international guests. A local band at such an event, unfortunately does not fit the character of an international association's meeting. However, since you made a concession regarding the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris , I would consider FreeLife the music act at our event. The popularity is not exactly comparable to DJ Happy, but maybe this band is more appropriate in your opinion?  Music Act: FreeLife   Besides the direct payment of Art Inc., they have supported ISA for a long time and therefore I am absolutely sure that their support will continue in the future. So why would we choose Boomerang because of their long-term contract if we have a kind of long term contract with Art. Inc anyway? So I still prefer Art Inc. as our sponsor.  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   I see your point in the catering issue and that you prefer a more formal catering but you have to consider that ISA is still a student organisation. Having a very formal meal where everybody sits down for several hours goes completely against the idea of a relaxed and easy going atmosphere. In my opinion such atmosphere is needed to faciliate networking and make new acquaintances. The catering is the linchpin of our event so I would kindly ask you to rethink your suggestion.  Catering: International buffet   Great that we could agree on the date of the conference!  Date of Conference: Week 3   Best, Alex
Hey Alex, FreeLife is in my opinion better than DJ Happy but the improvement is rather marginal. I don't think it is a good idea to show no Russian cultural influence at all. You are right that this event has an international orientation but most of the guests will be from Russia and we cannot achieve our goal to impress the people from Russian companies without showing any interest in them and their culture. You are also right that ISA is a student organisation but only a very small part of the people at the event will be actual students, so I don't think this is an argument for an informal international buffet. The event should be suited for the guests and not for the organizing people. Most guests are important public figures or business people and both groups are rather used to formal manners and will possibly be disturbed by an informal buffet. The 40th anniversary should be really special and so serving Russian cuisine would be great to show our interest in local culture while still presenting the ISA as a formal, international organization. Furthermore before and after diner everybody still has the chance to talk to other guests, who are not sitting next to them and while eating you can focus on your communication when you don't have to walk to the buffet all the time. Music Act: FreeLife  Catering: local Russian cuisine   Selecting Art Inc. is a bit risky in my opinion. We don't have a written long-term contract and they can reject to continue paying every time they want. So Boomerang is all in all more reliable as a sponsor and gives the ISA more financial security. A new contract can help us personally, too. Our effort will be remembered a lot longer than the event itself because the contract can help the ISA for months or even years and this can help us both to, for example, get a job in the future. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang     Best, Chris
Hey Chris, I don't think that a buffet has to be informal. We can have a buffet and still remain classy. Itï¿½s just so much more convenient to have a buffet for socialising and meeting new people! Our guests are going to be quite international and therefore they will be probably mostly unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, and I can tell you from my own experience that Russian food is very simple and not that fancy either. Therefore I think it would be smarter to have some international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. Another thing we have to consider are vegetarians, vegans and the lactose- and gluten intolerant folks. I know that the Russian cuisine is quite meat-heavy and if we offer an international buffet, everyone is able to find something they can eat and therefore everyone will remain happy J I can't imagine anything worse than be forced to sit at one table with someone who can't eat anything from the menu. Therefore the international buffet woud be the perfect solution!  Catering: International buffet   If you would rethink your suggestion about the catering and consider the buffet I would make a considerable concession and agree on boomerang as the sponsor for our event, although I know Art Inc. is the better option.  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   I really hope we can agree on that! Best, Alex
Hello Alex, you are right, that maybe a big part of our guests will be unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, but isn't it a main principle of our organisation to be interested in other cultures and trying to learn and experience new things to broaden one's horizons? Doesn't this bring the people more together than a little chit-chat at the buffet? Furthermore, the Russian cuisine is very versatile, most dishes are just not commonly known. Not only meat but also vegetables are a big part of the Russian cuisine and the Russians are famous for their different types of vegetables in brine. So in general the Russian cuisine is no problem for vegans or vegetarians. The percentage of gluten- or lactose-intolerant people is very low and I am sure we can find a solution for these folks, even within the Russian cuisine. Catering: local Russian cuisine   The catering is all in all a very important aspect for me and with no Russian music act present I would miss a local touch for the event without the Russian food. As a compromise I could agree to Art Inc. as the main sponsor if we can agree on Russian cuisine. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Best, Chris
"Hey Chris,   if we can agree on DJ Happy as a music act, it's a deal! I think this is a fair offer, since I'm making such a huge concession regarding the russian cuisine. If I end up hungry after the conference, you will have to invite me to a gluten free vegan dï¿½ner in St. Petersburg. Think about it ;) Best, Alex  "
"Hey Alex, I think it's more fair if we choose FreeLife as a music act. I'm also making a huge concession in letting you choose our sponsor and I let you hold the speech in exchange for FreeLife as the music act. Alternatively it would be okay for me to have DJ Happy if I can hold the speech in exchange. And I also add a gluten free vegan dï¿½ner to both offers ;) Best, Chris  "
Hey Chris, alright then, let's call it a deal! I'm really looking forward to our conference and the gluten free vegan dï¿½ner :) Have a nice weekend! Best, Alex
"Hey Alex, I think this is a great deal for us both! The conference will be wonderful and I'm sure you will love the Russian cuisine more than your dï¿½ner ;) Thanks and have a nice weekend, too! Best, Chris"
Dear Chris, How are you doing? I am very pleased that we already have settled several points for our conference concept. However, I think we should discuss some things, so that our team hopefully will win the competition. First, I think we should make 2016 perfect by the anniversary of ISA. Hence, I would suggest the third week of December for the date of the conference. Date of Conference: Week 3   Next, I think we should talk about the catering. As there should be a situation during lunch which should enable people to get in touch, I would suggest having a buffet with a lot of international deliciousness.  Catering: International buffet   Due to the international guests we will have, I think they should be able to identify with the music, come together and talk to each other. Therefore, I would suggest DJ Happy. Music Act: DJ Happy  In the fourth place, we should think about the discourse by the opening ceremony. Because of my experiences in planning events for ISA, I want to ask you for doing the awards ceremony and I would deliver the opening speech. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Last but not least, whatï¿½s about the sponsor of the event? Due to the long tradition getting sponsored by Art Inc.,  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. I think we should keep this relationship.  All in all, I would be glad, if my proposals may settle for an agreement. Please contact me if there are certain facts which need further discussion. I look forward to your reply. Many regards, Alex
"Dear Alex, Thank you very much for your message and your input regarding OUR big project - planning the 40th anniversary of ISA and the celebration of the newly established subsidiary in Saint Peterburg! I think we can win this competition if we are working hard on it! I got a lot of experience from previous projects - so I think we will be very well prepared! Let's rock this! I think we already discussed some really imporatant issues, so let us continue and go through the open points: 1) Date: In my opinion Week 3 is not perfect due to the fact that Christmas is really close to that date and a lot of our Business Partners might be already on holiday. However, I would agree on Date of Conference: Week 3 if you can make some concessions on the following open issues... 2) Catering:  I think your idea is great that there must be the opportunity to get in touch with other attendees! Therefore, I would suggest we draw lots who is going to sit next to each other on a table. So we make sure that there will be possibilities for networking and get to know new people. But Alex, a buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. We have to be aware that there will be many important guests (CEOs, Politicians etc.) who expect a certain level of formality. Therefore, it is really important to convince our guests with a menue: Catering: local Russian cuisine 3) Music: I can see your point with DjHappy and international music. However, I heard about festivals with Dj Happy as the performer and everyone focused just on him! There is no way we can accept that our event is seen as a ""side-act"" to our musician. I made really good experiences with local Russian bands. Our focus should be on establishing a good relationship with (local) companies and officials. Therefore, it is really important that we will have the following musiciansMusic Act: Local Russian band   4) Presentation: I would do it the other way round. Due to the fact that I have some linguistic proficiency in Russian and I know the culture very well I already have a lot of great ideas for the opening speech! This will be the best speech ISA has ever seen and heard! Therefore I suggest Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex 5) Sponsor: Alex I know that we have had Art Inc. as a sponsor for several events. However, they do not want to sign a contract with us. Do you know why? They want to stay independent - if the economy becomes worse, they will stop their payments to us! This will the worst case for us! We cannot let this case happen! We need to make sure that ISA is in a strong financial position, otherwise we can close our new subsidiary faster than we expected. I found a company that is willing to sign a long-term contract for us! This would be fantastic for ISA and of course for the financing of our event! Everyone will be very much delighted if we can make a deal with Sponsor Selection: Boomerang .   I think we are on a great way and we will achieve a fantastic concept for this event! Hope you can see my points that are in the interest of achieving the best result possible! I think we will rock this concept and convince everyone. Looking forward to hear from you Alex. Best regards, Chris  "
"Hi Chris, Iï¿½m glad to hear from you. Thankï¿½s a lot for your quick answer. Like me, you seem to be highly motivated and confident that we will do a good job and win the competition. In my opinion thatï¿½s the best pre-condition for this project; our project. Nevertheless, there are still some points I want to talk about. Of course, as you already mentioned, we should discuss issues depending on other onesï¿½ Regarding your proposals about the Sponsor Selection and the Catering I would be fine with, if we could find the agreement that I get to decide the rest. Hence our concept would have the appearance as followed: Date of Conference: Week 3   Catering: local Russian cuisine   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   I look forward to your reply. Best wishes, Alex"
Hi Alex, Thank you for your immediate response! Great to hear that you think the way I do - that makes it easier for us to succeed with our project work. However, we need to discuss some issues that I can't accept due to the fact that this event will be of such high importance. Alex, I have really big concerns about the Music Act with DJ Happy - there is no guarante at all that his reputation will overshadow the reputation of ISA, distracting attention from the event towards the music act. You know that music is a means to connect different cultures and helps building a bridge to the local people. We need to show respect and appreciation to our new Russian members and guests with local Russian music. You know that this year's competition is of high importance to the ISA, since an earlier attempt to establish an office in Moscow had failed in 2004. We cannot risk that this event will fail again and the local Russians reject this project!!! There will be really no other choice than going with the local Russian band - it will be the best for the local event! It is really hard for me to not give the speech at the event because it is really important to me to speak to such a huge audience! As I already told you I have a lot of ideas for this speech - to communicate important aspects of the future of ISA. In addition, I know that this will have a high impact on your future perspectives in ISA. However, I think you will do great on the speech and I can be fine with giving the awards for several ISA members that have made a big impact for the ISA organisation in the past. In addition, although Week 3 is not the best possible solution for me, I think we have to focus not only what is best for us but on the interests of everyone - so I will go with your offer for Week 3. I can see that we are coming closer to an agreement and trying to find out what is best for everyone who is going to attend the event and also for our team concept! To sum up, I will suggest the following: Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Hope you will have a nice evening Alex. Talk to you soon! Best regards, Chris
Hi Chris, Many thanks for your quick reply. Iï¿½m really excited how things will proceedï¿½ In the same way Iï¿½m thankful about your concessions you already made. Summarized, we already found an agreement about: the Sponsor Selection: Boomerang , the Date of Conference: Week 3  and the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  . However, I canï¿½t agree on the two remaining points (Music Act and Catering) preferred by you. As you already mentioned, this event of ISA is of high importanceï¿½ So itï¿½s also very important to my future. Furthermore, Iï¿½m sure you got the idea that I also have to achieve my objectives within planning the conference concept... I got your importance of the focus on local people and want to take it into account. But in my opinion, not at least because of the name of ISA (International Student Association), we should become a bit more internationally focused. Therefore I suggest meeting us in the middle: Catering: International three course meal and  Music Act: Local Russian band . I hope this would be ok for you, otherwise I canï¿½t accept. Looking forward to your reply. Best regards and have a nice day, Alex
"Good evening Alex, I appreciate that we can see a clear progress regarding our big project for 2016! Well, I can understand that you are concerned about the lack of internationality. Of course, there will be a lot of international guests and members of ISA - since we are an International Student Association. Alex, I still can't get used to the thought that I will not have the chance to overtake the opening speech. It was alway my dream to speek in front of such a big crowd and everyone listens to my thoughts about our current problems, but also about the bright future of ISA. I thought a lot about how I can make some concessions - and I came to the conclusion that I'm willing to offer you to go for the ""International buffet"" as you preferred due to all these international guests that might be a little bit sensitive regarding the local russian food. In exchange, I would love to let my dream come true - giving the opening speech and you will overtake the awards. I really hope that this offer finds you well!  Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Thank you for your collaboration Alex! We will have a great time and organize the best event we've ever had at ISA. Looking forward to your acception of the offer. Kind regards, Chris"
Good evening Chris! In spite of our keen discussions, I hope you are fine. Iï¿½m pleased to hear from you and your additional concessions. In my opinion we found fair compromise solutions not only in getting more international focused and your chance for the opening speech. Consequently, I will accept your final offer! Iï¿½m still confident that we did a good job and will win the competition. I look forward to meet you at the anniversary of ISA in 2016. It was a pleasure to work with you. Best regards, Alex
Hi Chris, first of all, thank you for your engagement in planning the event so far. I enjoyed working with you and had the chance to learn some important things about ISA as well as about planning events.   I am very happy that you agreed on using negoisst to come to a compromise, which will be not only accaptable but also a good one for both of us.   I am not quite sure yet how we proceed in the negotiation about the open issues. What do you think? Would you like to go through the issues one by one? If yes, what order do you suggest?   Have you heard about DJ Happy? He released his new album last week. It's very impressive - he's quite famous with us students. What do you think about iniviting him to play in St. Petersburg?   Thanks again and best regards, Alex
Hi Alex, really nice to hear from you. Yes using negoist is one of the best options we have. About your question how to proceed with all the issues. I wouldn't seperate the issues. The best way to handle it, in a efficient and not time wasting way would be if we could just speak and discuss really interactive about all issues at the same time. Regarding your other point about what kind of music we should choose. I know DJ Happy really well, but I guess for such a event which will be represent for our new subsidary in Saint Petersburg I would prefer at least a local music actor. Depending on the country where the event would take place, therefor I would prefer local russian dishes. What do you think about it, should we have a menu card or a buffet? The commission just gave us this time periode of 5 weeks, but I think you will agree with me if I'm saying december is really bussy. Not just only of christmas you know about the other upcoming event? I had done quite a lot of experience with ISA. I think you will agree that sharing the presentations activities would be just confusing other people. For me it wouldn't be a problem to make the first speech act to kindly inform and welcome the guest. I had done such ceremony really often in the past and I know how to handle this. I think for you it would be the best way to learn from me and afterwards we could discuss about this and you would be well prepared for the awards speech. That's the best way to practice for you (great choice) and lots of people would listen to you, so you could be really proud. Awards are always really important at such events to honar somebody. Grea For the sponsoring selection I first want to hear your point of viewing. I have to think about this first of all, because quite a lot of facts have to be focused here. I have some thoughts about all 4 of them. I will come with further remarks to you as soon as possible. You know to plan such an importing event we should work really efficient. I'm glad to work with you. Thanks in advance and I appreciate to hear from you soon. Best regards Chris  
Hi Chris,   thanks for your response. I really appreciate your effort and your very detailed answer. I will try to answer as your questions as good as possible. However, I see some issues that need a clarification:             With regards to the menu, I don't know what exactly you are asking about. What do you mean by menu card? As far as I know we came up with three options - local Russian cuisine, buffet or three course meal. Hereby, the buffet and the three course meal would be international food. From my point of view there is no menu card where people could choose their meal a la carte.   The week 3 you proposed to me already feels like a good enough idea. I agree that the last weeks of December are quite busy, especially around Christmas. What event are you talking about? I heard that there will be the International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow in the first week of December.   Let me also give you my thoughts on the sponsor selection. I am very much concerned about the long term relationship to the sponsor we might select or not select. Especially with Art Inc. we have been working together a long time. However, Boomerang seems like a company that we might be able to build up a close and long term-oriented relationship with. So, it's hard to favor one over another. Also Corporate Ltd. and Documenta have made very competitive offers for supporting the event. What do you think? Do you think we are going to have similar events in future that might be supported by one of those sponsors again?   One last remark about the music and the dishes. How come that you think it's important to serve Russian dishes and play Russian music? I am sure you agree that ISA is an International organization, which is not only present in Russia. That also means that we will have quite a lot International attendees.   I really appreciate to work with such an enthusiastic and experienced person on that event. I am really looking forward to be on stage side by side with you.   Best regards, Alex
Hi Alex, Sorry for the missunderstandig, I meaned local russian cuisine and not. I would choose a local russian cuisine, because if you already said right ISA is an international well known organization. Also be aware of the fact, that the we are doining this event because we want to open and welcome our new subsidary in russia. Therefor I would be really polite to serve local russian cuisine. I went to a lot of such events in the past and ISA always had the philosophy to accept the other nationality. For me one of this parts of accepting another nationality would be serving at such an important event local cuisine. What do you think if we do it like that. Local russian cuisine and of the music act we could choose the pop band FreeLife. I read and herad about a good recommondation of this guys. I think you will agree on the fact that the music act is just a side fact of such an event. We want an interactive communication with the guest. Therefor DJ Happy wouldn't be a good choice, because I know his kind of music and its a really load and incongruous actor. I also think his show will overshadow the reputation of ISA beyond this event. Great so we can agree on the date of the conference. Which should take place at the 3th week of december. Therefor I will make a remark in our concept file. Regarding the sponsor selection: As you said the choice should be depend on financing further events and not just only choose the one, who offers the most money only for this upcoming event. Therefor I would be choose a sponsor which also willing to sign a long term contract. So from my point of view Boomerang would be the best option. I know they wan't spent as much money as Art Inc like you said before, but for my I think ISA is more interesting in having a sponsor which is willing to support them also on other events. I think (I don't know) they planning to open more and more subsidaries and doiing events like this. As you haven't mentioned anything about the presentation task, I think you agree on my suggestion from yesterday. You are doing the awards and I will do the opening speech. As I said before, I think doining it in a way like that means, that we are able to discuss after my speech and you would be better prepared. I have a lot experiences on such tasks. Thats's fine for you?    I really like to work with you. I'm looking forward to hear from you. Best regards and enjoy your evening, Chris
Hi Chris,   thanks for your response. I am very happy that you share the idea that this event should be fostering conversation and communication among the participants, while also emphasizing to the Russian culture.   I do agree that ISA has a history of always accepting the local culture and nationality of the countries our subsidiaries are located in. This can be best done by creating an atmosphere that supports people to get in touch with each other. This is definitely something I would pay attention to while selecting the catering. What do you think? How could we create that kind of atmosphere during the dinner? On the one hand it could be nice to have people seated together, however on the other hand I often attended events where I had the chance to start a chat at the buffet.   With regards to the music, probably you are right. It's more or less a something that is running in the background. So, we should not distract people from the actual event, which should not have the atmosphere of an event. I am sure DJ Happy would have attracted lots of students, but I didn't consider this issue from the perspective you came up with. That's why I agree on the pop band FreeLife.   I felt a little bad when I read your comment on the date. I just mentioned, that I'd rather pick one of the earlier weeks, but not necessarily the third one. I'd prefer the first week. Or is there something that blocks that week? You mentioned an event, but did not give me more details on that?   Lastly, let make one thing clear. I absolutely believe that you are a great speaker and that you have a lot of experience with public addresses. However, for this event it might be confusing people if we switch between you and me all the time. That's why I think about hiring a third person that moderates the whole event. Don't you think, that this would be the appropriate thing to do?   Even while working on our event I enjoy the evening.   Thanks and best regards, Alex
"Hi Alex, I think the best way to creating such kind of atmosphere would be if we start some discussion or present additional information on further projects and we are saying to the participants: ""What do you think?"" Than we should add some additional breaks while the overall event so therefore people get in touch and discuss about there thoughts about this named topic and of course the will also speak interactive about other things. I'm sorry but I thought you pointed your preference for week 1 also. I thought you know already, that while the first week there would be another huge international conference on Economics and Business Management, one of the biggest business conferences in Russia. This event will take place in Moscow and not in Saint Petersburg, but that doesn't matter. That's why I preferred week 3. Companies have more than one representative, so if quite a lot of important people would join this international confernce that shouldn't have a impact on our event. I'm not really happy with this solution but if you are not willing to choose the 3th week, I would agree on the point to choose the first december week. Any remarks on this? Perfect for music we agreed on the pop band FreeLife. Great, at least I preferred on of the local Russian guys, but ok for me it's fine. We should focus on finding a joint solution. Regarding the presentation tasks: Maybe you are right with the point you pointed out, that two different speakers would confuse peoples, but not if we are doing it like I pointed out. People only get confused if we would switch while moderating one part (opening speech or awards). So I would agree on your thoughts if we would share the speech acts, but that's what I definitely don't want to do. think its quite more interactive if one of us is doing the speech act and the other the awards moderation.  I won't hire a third person. Just think about the additional costs and what would other ISA members think. I think the would believe we are not able to do that. I'm not willing to explain to committee and Dr. Roman Illenschitz, why we think choosing a third person would be the best option, if both of us attending the whole evening as well. What do you think if I would do the opening speech and you are doing the awards moderating? Can you agree on that? You haven't mentioned something about the sponsor selection. Would that mean, that you agree on my point. I think choosing Boomerang is the best option we have, because the would offer us financial stable situation of other further events as well. Just to sum up: We agreed at least on the following points: Local Russian cuisine and for the timeslot as a possible date of the conference, I made the concession to choose the first December week. Have a nice day. Best regards, Chris"
"Hi Chris,   I am very happy that you shared your point of view on the date of the conference. I knew there was a conference in Moscow. The fact I didn't know was that it is on of the biggest ones in Russia. Of course I don't want the companies to send only their ""B-Team"" to our conference. So we might miss the opportunity to make an important first step in developing a good cooperation between ISA and those companies.   I also see that the presentation that you are not happy with a third person as a speaker. I must admit, I didn't think of the costs associated with that. I can imagine better things to do than to explain those additional costs to Dr. Illenschitz.   Unfortunately, I have to tell you that I still have a bad feeling about the catering. I cannot image how people could be very communicative while trying to figure out what exactly is in their Borscht or pulling out salted herring out of a layer of vegetables. I not trying to insult Russian cuisine, but I hope you get my point. Our international guest might feel uncomfortable with such dishes. I am sure you agree that a bad dinner can ruin the whole evening.   So, as I am really trying - as you are as well - to find a solution that suits both of us, let me propose the following: A third speaker / as well as shared activities for the speech are not the favored options for you. Also, you'd prefer week 3 as a date for the conference. How about this compromise: We let the event take place in Week 3, you give the opening speech, I hand out the awards and instead of Russian cuisine we serve an international buffet, which allows for quick and relaxed chats among the participants.   How does that sound to you?   Wish you a pleasant afternoon,   Alex"
  Hi Alex,   thats sounds good for me, but for the catering I would imagine a other choice would be much better. Please read the following. Also you haven't respond to me with your prefernces about the sponsor selection   I would agree on the point that we could serve international cuisine. For me business meetings should serve a buffet, that would be a bad option. Everybody would run to the buffet and looks really bad, especially because so many people are joining our event. So I will make the concession to serve a international cuisine but not a buffet. If it has to be international I would prefer on an international three course meal. Is that fine for you? That's much higher standard and remember if you are joining a event like that you always would remember on the food. So therefore buffet is not acceptable for me   But whatï¿½s about the sponsor selection. You haven't respond to me so far! Could you just give me your thoughts, why you are not willing to prefer one. From my point of view Boomerang would be the best one, because they are willing to sign a long term contract. So the financing of further events should be fine. I think Dr. Illenschitz would appreciate that as well and would be really happy.   Best regards,   Chris  
Hi Chris,   I am happy that we can agree on the Date of Conference: Week 3  , the Music Act: FreeLife  and the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  .   Today is the final day of our preparation period and I am pretty sure that we will reach a good solution for both of us. I see your reasons for selecting Boomerang as a sponsor. They offered a very good short-term payment and they are signaling the willingness to sign a long-term sponsorship. However, please keep in mind that we have been successfully working with Art Inc. over the last years. They always provided financial support for us and will - for sure - continue to do so in future. As you might know, Boomerang is a direct competitor of Art Inc. So, I am ver worried about contracting Boomerang and at the same time loosing the support of Art Inc., which we had and will have for many more years. That means, I'd rather select Art Inc. than Boomerang. How do you think about that. Furthermore, we are not dependent on a short term payment as we decided against DJ Happy and a third person moderator, which both would have been expensive.   I wish you a good start in your day.   Regards, Alex
Hi Alex,   you have the choice now also to make some concessions. I have done quite a lot of concessions in the past, please be aware of that.   You didn't mentioned something about my suggestions with the international thress course meal. Why are you not disuss with me, come on I told you last time why we should choose the international three course meal. I always forgot about the upcoming further events in the next few months. How could Art Inc. support our events? There is now way for further events with them. Therefor we have to select Boomerang. Please give me some hints how you would explain that to Dr. Illenschitz. I know him really well and I think he wouldn't be happy if we wouldn't have choose a sponsor, which isn't us supporting the next events as well. Please be aware of this fact.   Let's make also concessions. Come one we should end this negotiation in a succesful way. I hope you will respond soon! Best regards Chris
Hi Chris, thanks for your quick response. That's good that we speed up a little bit now. I did not comment on your choice of the three course meal because I thought that I made it clear that I prefer a buffet. So, this means that I wanted people to eat and have chats with each other. I don't see that happening if we serve a rather formal a three course menu.   I see your concerns regarding Art Inc. as a sponsor. You are right - Boomerang is offering a long-term contract explicitly. On the other hand, I am very sure that Art Inc will continue their cooperation as they did in the last years, unless we give them a reason for not doing so (by selecting Boomerang). I am very confident that this is a good decision, which I am happy to present to Dr. Illenschitz if you don't want to do that.   I am a little bit disappointed that you did not see the concessions I made. I let you choose the week 3 and the the pop band, which I did not prefer. More important I noticed that the presentation task is ver important to you. So, I decided to give you the chance to give the openening speech.   I am still very sure, that we will find a final solution today.   Looking forward to your response. Best Regards, Alex
Hi Alex, I'm not suprised about your decision, choosing the international buffet. I told you a few days before, that an event like that shouldn't serve a buffet. Really important guest are coming from well known companies. They don't want to run to the buffet and waiting to get some food. Please be aware about the fact, that I prefered at the beginning the local russian cuisine.  I would make my LAST concession: I would agree on the point choosing international buffet. But be aware of the thoughts that I told you before, I don't think we offer ISA a really good concept with this way of catering. I gave up quite a lot of important things. I prefered the local russian cuisine and I agreed on your point choosing an international cuisine. I think you are not mentioning what I gave up in the past. I also told you right at the beginning the local russian band I would prefered. So therefore we both agreed on the freelife pop band. You really don't get my point, as I told you about selecting one sponsor. Thererfore I don't want to make another concessions on the sponsor selection. Now, it's your choice if we could work together in the futher or we are not able to. Now, you have to make a concession too!!! Thanks and I would appreciate to hear from you as soon as possible. Best regard, Chris    
Hi Chris, I think we got it. I hope you are equally satisfied with our negotiation. Your last offer is a compromise I can work with very well.   I am now looking forward to the event itself. It is a pleasure working with you.   Best Regards, Alex
Dear Chris, I am Alex. First of all it is a pleasure for me to be your team mate and even we do not know each other yet, I really enjoyed our first cooperation.   After we have settled some issues for the conference, it seems that your main focus concentrates on the successful collaboration with local business people and officials. Am I right? I think, first of all it would be profitable to talk about the general main focus we should set.  In my opinion this will be the first step to ensure an acceptable and beneficial final result of the competition before we continue negotiating about unresolved issues concerning music art, catering, date of the conference and presentation tasks. Probably it will be easier for each of us if we understand the main focus of our counterpart. Best regards and thanks in advance for answering. Sincerely Alex
Hi Alex, thank you for your message. The pleasure working with you is also on my side and I'm looking forward to organising a successful event. As the upcoming event is planned to be used as leverage to assure a successful start for the new office in Russia, it is important to establish contacts to as many local business people and officials as possible. From my previous experience in organising internships for other students, I have gaines profound knowledge about the business contacts of ISA and their interests. Since most of the conference program is already set and probably also includes the framing conditions of typical international ISA events, it is also important to include some local aspects as the success of ISA was always based on a successful adoption of the local culture. Further, this is also a vital part of creating good relationships with our future business partners in Russia. Therefore I already thought about the perfect concept for the upcoming conference and ISA's 40th birthday, so we definitely win this years competition! First of all, we need to select a sponsor for the event as several companies are willing to sponsor various amounts of money or promotional goods. Boomerang made a very good offer and is also willing to sign a long-term contract. This would be a great opportunity to ensure our financial security for the several upcoming events and to some extent for the ISA itself. Second, we should decide about the music act. As I already mentioned, I think it is very important to show some appretiation to our local guests. Therefore we should choose a local Russian band that has a good local opinion and not too controversial songs. In addition, we should have a local 3-course Meal to meet a certain level of formality and satisfy our special (local) guests. As we also know, the opening ceremony also consists of a speech by the organisers as well as the announcement of this year's awars winners. I would agree on doing the opening speech, so you could announce the winners. Finally, I would suggest to have the event in the 3rd week of December. As far as I know, there are no other events or reasons against it. So my offer would be as follows: Catering: local Russian cuisine   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang     Best Regards Chris
Hey Chris, thanks a lot for your response. In contrast to your opinion I think we should consider that ISA is made unique by the youth driven impactful experience all over the world. Due to the fact that ISA is one of the worldï¿½s largest organizations focusing on students and their needs, we cannot leave out their roots and uniqueness ï¿½young people for young peopleï¿½. Otherwise ISA is not able to justify the ï¿½studentï¿½ in the name anymore. In addition, attracting students implicitly means attracting businesses which also will be fit in with your focus on establishing contacts to local business people. I absolutely agree with you to consider the local aspects but establishing an office in Russia had already failed in 2004 as seen in Moscow. The reason for that is of course getting away from the core business of ISA, the students. That is why there are some inconsistencies between your offer and my concept about following issues:   I get your idea of taking Boomerang as sponsor (due to the long term perspective), but our team performance is measured by organizing this event. So I rather take Art Inc. as a sponsor. Until now they are supporting ISA for a long time and if we take Art Inc. there will be no reason for them not to continue sponsoring ISA in the future. If we rather prefer Boomerang which offers slightly less money Art Inc. gets a reason not to be a sponsor in future anymore. I am able to accept week 3 as the date of the conference. But therefore we urgently have to talk about the catering. Concerning the catering the International three course meal and local Russian cuisine are absolutely no options. The event is about to establish contacts between students and business people. Whereby the formal three course meal does not support this aim, the International buffet is much more suitable. If you can walk around and there is a relaxed atmosphere and therefore it is quite easier to talk to many different interesting people and establish contacts. So the business people have the chance to get to know the students. It also ensures that everyone find anything to eat. And due to it is an international event we can assume that there are a lot of people who definitely emphasize much on an international food. So your idea about the international food was really good which I never would replace by local food. In addition, the local Russian band does not play music which meets the international character of this event and also is not interesting for gathering and tempting young people. I guess that also the local business people would like to hear international music. That is why DJ Happy, a famous performer who fills huge venues, is the better option to attract people and fit the international importance. For the opening ceremony the more beneficial alternative will be a third person. An external speaker is absolutely worth because he talks about the importance of the ISA for the business world which increases the attractiveness of ISA in the eyes of the business people. I think this also would be in your interests creating a good relationship to the local Russian business people. Attached you can find a summary of my new offer. Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: DJ Happy   Presentation Tasks: Third person   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   I wish you a nice evening and I am looking forward to a soon response. Best wishes Alex
Hi Alex, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm glad to hear that we already agreed on the Date of Conference: Week 3 I get your idea of keeping the concept closer to an student event. Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that this conference will be very special as it is also ISA's 40th anniversary. In combination with the celebration of the newly established subsidiary in St. Petersburg it definitely is a perfect opportunity to stregthen the relationships between all stakeholders for a successful future of the ISA and the Russian office. We should use this formal event to show our professionality as many important people will attend the event. If they get a good first impression it will increase our chances winning them as business partners. This is vital for sucessfully establishing the newly opened office. Anything less than a three course meal would definitely be a decline from the conferences over the last few years, which weren't even some special events as the upcoming one. A buffet is more suited to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. So this would definitely harm the prestige of ISA. We should also keep in mind that showing appretiation is very important in the Russian culture and will be honored by our guests.  Catering: local Russian cuisine   As we both know, an attempt to open an office in Russia in 2004 failed due to unforeseen problems in the preparation. Consequently, ISA wants to try some new concepts in this second attempt. A very good way to do so is by focusing on local aspects. The music act is an easy way to show ISA's interest in the Russian culture and support the idea of establishing good relationships with the local companies and officials. In our prior discussion you already mentioned DJ Happy and FreeLife. Unfortunately I think that DJ Happy is no option since there is no guarantee that his reputation would not overshadow the reputation of the ISA and also distract the attention from the event to the music act. I really can't imagine such a big performer as DJ Happy to be a 'side-act'. FreeLife is also an internationsl band and probably wouldn't meet the Russian music taste. In contrast, by hiring a Russian band we would definitely satisfy our guests and more important we could differentiate our concept for the others that will be presented and win the competition.  Music Act: Local Russian band   As you already mentioned, you don't want to toally leave out the idea of being a student organisation. Therefore I think we as the organizers should use the opportunity and do the presentation tasts ourselves. First of all, we know ISA better than a third person and there would be additional costs (financial and organisational effort) for hiring him/her. Further, we should use the public attention to be recognized for our work organizing the event. So a third speaker would definitely harm both our interests. However, if you are worrying about the additional effort for preparing the opening speech, I could take over the speech and you do the award presentation.  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Although there will still be an uncertainty if we select Art Inc. as main sponsor, the higher amout that is offered is also an argument to be considered. However, they can still change their mind for sponsoring our future events if they don't sign a long-term contract. As they are already supporting us for a long time and for several events, I agree on maintaing our good relationship with them and again select them as our main sponsors.  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.     Best Regards, Chris
Hi Chris, it is great to hear from you. First of all, I am glad to hear that we already have reached an agreement about the sponsoring (Art Inc. as our main sponsor). It is really good that you mentioned the special meaning of the event: the ISAï¿½s 40th anniversary which simultaneously means the anniversary of an international organization running by young people. That is exactly the reason why we have to take youth and international aspects into account, especially concerning the catering. It is not only important to represent ISA as a young driven organization, but also as a highly international-oriented organization. Internationality means progress and progress is only possible if there are open-minded persons. Therefore potential local business partners expect to meet young and open-minded people at this event instead of already grown business experts. Their aim is to communicate with these young people. The danger not to represent a liberal-minded organization increases by not choosing the International buffet. We have to signal the locals to be that open-minded which they expect us to be. Therefore it absolutely will be an excellent chance to enable informal communications between all stakeholders. By choosing the local Russian cuisine we hinder the communicational exchange between students and business people. But not even students, also established members of ISA, as the CEO Dr. Illenschitz, get the possibility to start or refresh contacts with (local) business people. So choosing the International buffet improves the chance to establish and strengthen contacts and relationships for the future. In my opinion the International buffet is the one and only option we should consider when negotiating about the catering. Instead I rather would use the opening speech to meet your mentioned aspects of showing professionality to our potential business partners. Therefore I share your opinion about demonstrating a very good first impression. The opening speech will be the best chance for the audience to get a first impression. Thatï¿½s why we should keep in mind that a third person will be more competent than anyone of us could be. So in case the formal and professional first impression is a such important matter for you I rather would hire an external speaker for the opening speech, although it goes hand in hand by additional costs and effort. Also keep in mind that there will be the possibility that the one of us holding the speech could make a lot of mistakes due to nervousness. Mistakes in the opening speech are a sign of incompetence. Furthermore the speech itself is not a real sign representing a ï¿½studentï¿½ organization. Itï¿½s rather the possibility to show appreciation while we let the locals know that is a pleasure for us to celebrate the 40th anniversary in Russia where we see excellent potential partners. Therefore, instead of choosing the local Russian cuisine, I rather would prefer hiring a third person for the opening speech to represent our professionality and appreciation. Although I do not see a risk by taking DJ Happy I can understand your worries that the music overshadows the original purpose of the event. But over the last years I noticed an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts because there have been no focus on choosing the right music. The local Russian band not seems to be suitable for such a huge event. It does not fit the character of such an international associationï¿½s meeting. Therefore I would suggest taking FreeLife. Hereby we run no risk to overshadow the main purpose of the event and no risk to bore the people. Attached you can find the summary of my counteroffer. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Date of Conference: Week 3   Catering: International buffet   Presentation Tasks: Third person   Music Act: FreeLife   Thanks in advance for answering. Best regards, Alex
"Hi Alex, thanks for the further explanation of your point of view and your counteroffer. Unfortunately, this is unacceptable for me and doesn't oblige me at all.  Although internationalisation is an important part of our core values, it is closely related to diversity, which is crucial for success. Being part of an international team/organisation also means understanding other cultures in order increase the benefit of working together and avoid missunderstandings. Consequently, it will also be interesting for our international guests/members to get to know the Russian culture a bit better and broaden their horizon above all. We should use this perfect opportunity to help our members to obtain these key competences, which are very important for a successful career nowadays. In addition, as we already discussed the previous opening failes due to holding on to our international concept. Especially, in the ""eastern world"" it is important to show your appreciation to the culture and don't make future partners and memebers unconfortable by ""Americanizing"" them. Based on my previous experience I'm sure this concept will be a great success. Furhtermore, it will meet ISA's requirement of including new ideas for the second attempt of establishing the office. I get your idea of socializing at the international buffet. However, after everyone got his/her food, everyone will be sitting again at their tables and usually go and get the food tablewise. So the chances to talk to each other because of the buffet are not mentionably increased and noone likes to stand somewhere having a plate full of food in their hand and talking while the food is getting cold. In addition the main socializing will happen at the party afterwards anyway. An international buffet would only demonstrate less formality and appreciation of our guests as well as the special event. Catering: local Russian cuisine   I also get your opinion about the presentation tasks. Nevertheless, I think it is very inconsistent to show professionality by hiring someone else for the speech. Firstly it demonstrates that we are not able to do the speech ourselves what will make our guests think we are not competent enough to work together with us. I already hold some bigger speeches, so this would definitely not be a problem for me. We can practice it in advance so there shouldn't be any unforeseen incidents. Secondly, a third person cannot know ISA as well as we do. We would have to provide a lot of information, so it would be easier to just do the opening ourselves. Thirdly, hiring a third person will waste money unnessesarily and last but not least, it is a great opportunity for us to get some recogintion for organising this big event. I can also prepare the award ceremony for you and would also be ok if you do the speech and I the awards. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Reargding the performing music act, I understand your point. Nevertheless, the band won't be playing the whole evening. It will just be the opening for the following party. The music played afterwards will be mixed, so everyone should definitely be satisfied. A local band will be an additional incentive for the guests of the event. The locals will like it and the internationals will have a rare opportunity to attend a concert of a Russian band and again broaden their horizon. Further, we could also choose a band with English songs, so everyone will understand the lyrics, but we still include the local aspect. In addition, having a band from overseas will also be way more expensive as we also have to cover their plane tickets and hotel rooms. As a result I see no better solution that having a local band. Music Act: Local Russian band   Date of Conference: Week 3   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   I'm looking forward to your reply, Chris"
Hi Chris, Thanks a lot for your quick response. I get the main idea of your further explanations, especially about the diversification and assigning to the Russian market. Unfortunately, I cannot accept all of your explanations and therefore I edit the offer. As I can see it is a major point for you to address the Russian particularity anyhow. But integrating aspects of the locals by offering Russian food will be not the right leverage point. As I know the Russians do not place a high value on formal course meals. That is why I researched a bit about the Russian etiquette. In Russian culture table manners play not that important role as we expect them to be. Before talking about the business, first of all it is important to Russians to have an extensive small talk to their opponents. Also Russians do not trust people who are only fixed to get the business done (this impression could be increased in form of a formal meal). For them it is important to build up trust before negotiating.  Therefore the buffet style exactly meets the Russian etiquette. It is most suitable to open the way for small talks and enabling first contacts. If you want I can enclose a summary of Russian etiquette I found. Just let me know. Furthermore I know that it is common to offer a buffet at such huge events. Experience shows that people do not fill their plates up to the edge if you offer a buffet. They rather go a second or third time to refill the plate. Also all people do not eat at the same time. So we should not be worry about that the food is getting cold and there will arise a dynamic to change seats which offers more communication possibilities. Another point is that it would be wasting money to serve a special meal (not necessarily just only the Russian kind of food) if the bigger part of the present people does not even eat only one bit of the meal because of its special tasting which definitely is not common to most of the people.   Additionally we can concept the International buffet in such a way that it includes some kind of Russian specialties.  I think this would be a great possibility to take your point into account that we should integrate the Russian aspect. For me it is a really important aspect that everyone joining the event can find anything to eat. With this solution we could meet any taste. Therefore I still campaign for choosing the International buffet and please you to think about my arguments. Nonetheless, I care about your fear not to meet the Russian particularity.  I do not really get your argument to choose a Russian band which is also singing English songs. Prior in your statement you pronounced that the Russians do not want to be ï¿½Americanizedï¿½. In my opinion taking a local band playing English songs will be totally contradictory to your statement about the ï¿½Americanizingï¿½. And as you said the band only will play the opening for the following party. A local band playing English songs do not really work. I cannot imagine that this would be impressive to our potential local partners as well as to the students. According to your suggestion to play mixed music at thee afterwards party anyway. So it will be more beneficial to choose one of the other alternatives (especially DJHappy). Taking a Russian local band playing some English songs will be not authentic.  And if your plans are to choose the music for the following party after the official parts happen, DJ Happy will be still the right decision. But as I know you want to introduce local aspects I got the following idea to arrange your interests: I suggest hiring a famous local Russian band which plays good traditional Russian music. The band should play the whole evening and bump up (in a smart sound level) the buffet. It probably helps to increase the relaxed atmosphere of the dinner and offers an additional entry point for small talks. Local business people and students get the possibility to take this as a first topic. Therefore it is also easier for students as well as for potential business partners to start the conversation. After dining the band can play famous traditional songs people can get into a good and relaxed mood. Although I still think the music act should be performed by DJHappy or any other attractive band to cover the international demand, I would agree to the local Russian band in case we take the International buffet and use the local Russian band already as a support and entry point of the communication exchange during the buffet. Well ok, I see your argumentation concerning the presentation tasks. From this point of view you are right. Probably we should do it ourselves. It is no matter for me to do the speech. In contrast it would be a great honor for me to perform the speech. So if you are fine with, I will do it. I also can introduce the local Russian band in the speech which points out our willingness to integrate local aspects. Hopefully now I found a solution to meet our main focuses in a compatible way, such we can reach an agreement. Again you can find the summary attached. Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.    I`am looking forward to your response. Have a nice day. Best regards, Alex
Good morning Alex, thanks for your additional research and your proposition. I'm ok with having an international buffet and a local Russian band instead. One last thing about the presentation tasks. Would you mind if I do the speeches and you the awards? As I'm about to finish my studies soon this would be a very nice opoortunity to finish my voluntary work for ISA in the last 5 years. This way we would also both get our prefered options in two of the issues, which would be great as our performance is measured on our joint outcome.  So I would suggest the following and hope we can agree on that: Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   I'm looking forward to a great event and hope we will win the competition with our concept!   Best Regards, Chris  
Good morning Chris, thank you for agreeing to my suggestion. Even if I have already been looking forward to do the opening speech, I have no problem if you absolutely want to do it. So I am fine with. I am glad to know that we have reached an agreement. Catering: International buffet   Date of Conference: Week 3   Music Act: Local Russian band   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   From my point of view, we've reached a common solution that suits both of us and promises a huge success for the competition. I really enjoyed negotiating with you and I am looking forward to our common organized event. Best wishes, Alex
Dear Chris, good to hear that we are working together. I really hope that we will design an interesting concept for the upcoming big ISA event! I think we have no time to spare, because we have only 5 days to discuss our preferences. Iï¿½m sure we will find a solution that will be fine for both of us! So I thought about some organizational points and I hope you will give me your thoughts about it: At first I thought about a Date of Conference: No Selection. There is a range of 5 weeks and a lot of pros and cons. The fifth week is the week around Christmas. I believe that we all have private events we would like to go to around Christmas, so we should focus on the earlier weeks. For the second week there are some higher members of ISA unavailable and I think we should find another week so they can participate as well.  So please give me your thoughts concerning your preferred week. Next point we should talk about is our Sponsor Selection: No Selection. There are four companies that are willing to sponsor our event, that sounds great! I think we should focus especially on two of them. There is Art Inc. that made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event and they have supported the ISA for a long time.  And the company Boomerang which offered less money for the event than Art Inc. but is interested in a long-term contract. What do you guess? Then we should talk about the event itself: the catering, the presentation and the music act. I think that international food would be perfect for everybody because the Russian guests could try some American food and the other way around. If we have international food, everybody is able to find something they like. I believe the point Presentation Tasks: Third person   is a bit difficult because I guess that we both would like to do the speech. So maybe it would be a compromise for both of us if an external speaker would do the opening speech and the award ceremony. What do you think? The last point concerns the Music Act: DJ Happy. I had the experience that the acts of the last years were always a bit boring and I noticed an increasing dissatisfaction. Therefore I believe that we should think about a famous international act that is also famous in Russia. Please give me your thoughts on my proposal! I really hope that we will find an agreement as soon as possible.   Kind regards, Alex
Dear Alex, thanks for your kind message and the prompt sending of your proposal. Iï¿½m really glad that weï¿½re going to work together as a team! Iï¿½m sure that we will come up with some great ideas and deliver an outstanding concept for the upcoming ISA event ï¿½ really looking forward to it! I fully agree that we should opt for a quick settlement of the remaining open issues. From my past experience in organizing events I can tell, that starting the actual preparation phase with some time-buffer always pays off at the end. Iï¿½m totally in-line with your argumentation regarding the date of the conference: We really shouldnï¿½t even consider week four and five as they are way too close to Christmas. As you already stated, week two might not be a suitable solution as well (especially when considering, that our concept may be judged by some of these high-ranking ISA members). Just going on by the process of elimination: in my opinion, the first week could also be a bit tricky as thereï¿½s a business conference going on in Russia. So, even though this probably would not be a show-stopper, Iï¿½d suggest week three. I really cross-checked a lot of upcoming events and it seems that there is none colliding with week three. Considering your proposed two potential sponsors: It seems to me that Art. Inc. really provided a generous offer. However, the benefit of Boomerang would be the long-term relationship that they are aiming for. We will definitely get the event organized with their one-time payment. Additionally, setting up the cooperation with them will save us a lot of time and money in the future with regards to their long-term contract. This will allow us to plan upcoming events more easily. Last but not least, their reputation is extraordinarily well ï¿½ so this will provide even more benefit to all our student members that attend the event. I hope you can follow my argumentation. However, I already did a lot of research and compared Art Inc. and Boomerang ï¿½ if you have any further questions do not hesitate to ask! The presentation task will probably require a lot of preparation and coordination for the presenter. Nevertheless, I would be totally willing to invest that time and effort. During my time with ISA Iï¿½ve already been hosting a couple of events ï¿½ so Iï¿½m sure I can benefit from these experiences. In this case, you could do the award-ceremony ï¿½ this wonï¿½t be too much of an extra-effort for you, as I could easily support you based on my previous experiences. Iï¿½m convinced that this could be a great compromise as well! If thatï¿½s fine for you I will start the speech planning as soon as possible. With respect to the catering as well as the music act our preferences slightly differ, even though I totally get your points. Nevertheless, concerning both issues I would be a bit more welcoming to our Russian guests. I donï¿½t know if youï¿½re aware of the problems we had when ISA opened an office in Russia for the first time ï¿½ even though everything went as planned, we just could not ï¿½get in touchï¿½ with the Russian people. Probably this is also due to their strong ï¿½patrioticï¿½ culture. With this in mind, I would really rather go for local Russian food. Taking into account that the Russian cuisine is moderately international (despite some local specialties), we can probably combine the best of two worlds by providing Russian food. Same logic applies to the music act: during our preparation and briefing we can talk to the Russian band and ask them to play internationally known as well as traditional Russian songs. Furthermore, even though I personally really like DJ Happy: he has an extremely dominant presence while being on stage. Due to this, Iï¿½m afraid that with him as the main act our event will become some sort of a ï¿½side-eventï¿½. Again, I hope you can follow my argumentation. If anything reamins unclear, just let me know!   As I already mentioned at the beginning: Iï¿½m really looking forward to our teamwork! Iï¿½m pretty sure weï¿½ll be able to deliver an excellent and convincing concept to the jury! Hope youï¿½re having a good start into the week! Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, At first I would like to thank you for your fast answer! I really appreciate that we have the same opinion concerning our teamwork! I also think we will achieve the best result if we are working together as a team! Your detailed counteroffer sounds very comprehensible to me. Nevertheless I would appreciate if we could talk about some points again please. Therefore please find below my point of view. Your argumentation regarding the date of the conference sounds good to me. I totally agree that week one and two wouldnï¿½t be a good opportunity regarding the other events and week four and five are too close to Christmas. So week three is perfect for me as well. Concerning the other points I hope that we can go into detail a bit more. I fully understand your doubts concerning the Russian guests. I understand your argumentation that you would like to welcome our guests. Please keep in mind that this is an international event. We are a big international organization and I believe we should think in international dimensions. The point that you would like to welcome especially our Russian guests I totally understand and support. I agree with you that some Russian aspects lead hopefully to a better relationship between ISA and Russia. I think that both - a local band and local food ï¿½ is not necessary. Otherwise it would be only a Russian and not a big international event. So my proposal is that we combine the Russian culture with our international standard. It would be fine for me if we are looking for a local Russian band. You are right that a local band could play some international songs as well. As a compromise we should organize an international buffet. We would have both: American food and Russian specialties as well - so there is food for everyone. The advantage of an international buffet is that we would have a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. Everybody can walk around and this point would be a perfect opportunity for talking and networking with our Russian guests! Concerning the sponsoring I really believe that Art Inc. would sponsor our event next time again because they have been sponsoring ISA for a long time. So if we think about the sponsor selection then we shouldnï¿½t forget the good relationship between Art Inc. and ISA. I trust you if you believe that Boomerang sponsors enough money for the event. So please think again about the possibilities whether the good relationship with Art Inc. or the less-money-offer of Boomerang would be the best decision. Last point I would like to talk about are the presentation tasks. Itï¿½s great that you already have some experience! Thatï¿½s perfect for our presentation tasks! If you would do the award-ceremony and I do the opening speech we both would be on the spot and I could learn a lot from you. That would be a great chance for me. Please think about the points above. If you have any questions, please let me know! I really hope that we will find a satisfied solution for both of us! Have a good day! Best regards, Alex
" Hi Alex,   I hope youï¿½re doing great and you had a good start into the week! Again, thanks for your immediate counteroffer as well as the detailed and well-grounded comments! Being honest, I think weï¿½re already pretty close to a perfect solution!So letï¿½s get this settled so we can start ahead of time with the actual planning phase. As always emphasized ï¿½ Iï¿½m totally happy to talk things through with you. So Iï¿½m glad you came up with all the things which you are still concerned or unsure about! Iï¿½m glad that you found my arguments for the sponsoring, the music act as well as the date of the conference reasonable. From my perspective there is nothing to add ï¿½ I fully agree with your last offer and Iï¿½d suggest we keep these points fixed. By doing so, we can avoid potential confusions.   Regarding the catering, Iï¿½m honestly still having a hard time. Yes, I really do see your points: we should not make it a ï¿½Russianï¿½ event. However, I think with respect to the evening program the international character of the event will nevertheless remain clear ï¿½ food and music acts are more of side-issues that create a nice atmosphere. Frankly speaking, I would really rather go for the local Russian food. On the other side, I can follow your arguments ï¿½ and even though I donï¿½t feel that we are too close to making it an all ï¿½Russianï¿½ event, I am willing to trust your reasoning and gut feeling. Letï¿½s get the Russian spirit via the music act and rather stick to international food ï¿½ maybe this really combines the best of both worlds! However, let us propose a three course meal instead of a buffet. Even though I see the potential benefits of walking around and having a chat, past experiences have confirmed my personal observation: for large conferences, better stick to a meal; for smaller groups (e.g. team meetings or maybe also department meetings/dinners) stick to a buffet. The sometimes chaotic way people behave when ï¿½fightingï¿½ for their ï¿½shareï¿½ of the food is usually creating a really stressful and sort of competitive atmosphere. I do strongly believe, that we should absolutely avoid anything like this on such an import conference with so many high-ranking ISA members as well as high-ranking company officials. This is especially important, as table talk typically tend to be more extensive and is therefore also beneficial when considering networking effects. All in all, Iï¿½d say offering an international meal sounds like the perfect compromise to me. If you feel good about this compromise, I can additionally make a concession at another point: the presentation. First, Iï¿½m super happy that you also found it reasonable to do the presentation tasks together. Iï¿½m sure, the preparation will be at least as much fun as the presentation itself. And, for sure, itï¿½s a great chance to also personally benefit a little bit. So, even though I would have preferred to take the lead and also prepare the opening speech, Iï¿½m fine with your suggested compromise. Surely, I would still be willing to do the major preparation tasks in order to have this issue settled as efficiently as possible (as mentioned, Iï¿½m sure we can benefit a lot from my previous experiences). That being said, Iï¿½m willing to accept your suggested compromise. In the meantime, I hope you can follow my reasoning for the three course meal over the buffet and we can sort of trade ï¿½concession for concessionï¿½. It would be an amazingly efficient and effective start into our upcoming teamwork if we could finalize this pre-planning procedure so fast.   Iï¿½m looking forward to your response! Best regards and have a pleasant evening Chirs          "
Dear Chris,      thank you very much for your offer, that looks really good! I have a good feeling that we will have a great concept! Our ideas sound promising!     Concerning the dinner I totally understand your point of view but honestly I believe that a formal three course meal is not really relaxed. The guests have to sit down for several hours with the same people. That's not really beneficial for networking and socializing! And I think that's an important point of having dinner: Everybody can talk to everyone. I think that a buffet would be much more familiar. For our guests it's not the first big event in their life therefore I believe that they know what to do that it's not chaotic. We just have to look for enough food and several food places. Please think about my thoughts again.   But if you have doubts concerning the dinner then I have another proposal for you. If the three course meal is so important for you, then I hope we can find a compromise: we could choose the three course meal and then please comply with my suggestion and let's decide for Art Inc. as our sponsor. They have supported ISA for a long time and I'm sure that the company will support us in the future again. The fact that they will pay more money would be perfect because we would have some extra money.     Please think about my proposal and give me your thoughts. I'm really looking forward to receive your answer! I'm pretty sure that we will achieve a great result!   Have a great evening!   Best regards,   Alex
"Hi Alex, thanks for your counteroffer. Iï¿½m sorry to say so, but I personally have the feeling we start turning circles. Didnï¿½t we already agree on Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  ? In my opinion, sponsor selection and catering should not be considered as bundles. Boomerang clearly offers the most long-term benefits for ISA - and being able to think several steps ahead is a characteristic that is usually very important to the jury members that are going to judge our concept draft. So, based on all the arguments already mentioned, I would really stick to Boomerang. Itï¿½s the first choice for ISA and for the evaluation of our concept as well. Perfect win-win. Regarding the catering: I totally agree with all the arguments you brought up before - we should not blur the international focus. That being said, I donï¿½t agree with your recent arguments. The dinner wonï¿½t take forever and people do still have plenty of time for strolling around during the aperitif as well as especially subsequent to the dinner. As I already mentioned: most studies come up with the result, that achieving a relaxed atmosphere is alomost always achieved (for large groups) by having a formal dinner rather than offering a buffet. Last but not least: I feel that I already made a significant concession regarding the presentation tasks. Donï¿½t get me wrong: Iï¿½m totally happy with that concession and Iï¿½m sure that splitting the tasks for the presentations was a very good idea. Still, I donï¿½t really want to go for another compromise just for the sake of it. I would strongly suggest, we stick to fact-based argumentation in order to generate some real long-lasting value for ISA and all external participants. This will clearly improve our concept compared to trading compromises ;) Please donï¿½t get me wrong - I just want to stay as objective as possible in order to achieve the greatest joint utility for us as well as all event-guests! Hope youï¿½re having a great evening! Best regards, Chris"
"Good morning Chris, thank you for your answer! As I can see you are a nighthawk - that will be perfect for long nights of organizing ;-) I'm sorry, I really didn't want that you have the feeling that we start from the beginning concerning our preferences. But I had the feeling that this is not our best solution yet. That was the reason for an alternative offer. But after your answer I think that the offer was worse concerning your preferences so that our joint utility would decrease. And that's not our aim. Overall that looks really good. As you said as well, we definitely should look for our best joint utility! And after your answer I have the feeling that we found the best solution or that we are really close to it. I would like to say thank you! It was a pleasure for me to discuss with you our possibilities and to find such a good compromise. I hope we found the best solution for both of us and hope that we will have a lot of success but fun as well by starting with the real event organization. Have a great day and I keep in touch with you concerning the next steps! Best regards, Alex"
"Hi Alex, good to hear from you - the pleasure is on my side! Iï¿½m glad that we finally (but nevertheless quiet quickly) came up with a good solution: I will happily accept the current offer. Hope youï¿½re having a great day and lloking forward to meet you soon - Iï¿½m sure the (potential) night shifts will be fun ;) Best regards and enjoy the upcoming weekend Chris"
Dear Chris,   I am very pleased that you are my partner for this year's competition. I look forward to negotiating with you and to trying to get the best team concept for the anniversary event. I have already collected and developed some ideas how to organize the special event. Please find attached my first offer regarding the five issues (sponsor selection, music act, presentation tasks, date of conference, catering) we need to consider for the event. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact and ask me.   I look forward to your counteroffer.   Thanks!   Alex
  Dear Alex, i'm glad to hear from you. I can see you've already made some planing. I think we really have a shot at having the best team concept. Therefore I also made some planing on how we can arrange the event. So i think you've made some good points at the things we have to plan. Nethertheless I made some adjustments on your offerings. I like your decision on the date od conference. I think we both than agree on having it at Week 3 . Even though Art. Inc will offer us the most money for the event we should think about a sponsor that will pay more in the long run. I also think having a sponsoring partner that will work with us in a long-term relationship will show that we're a trustworthy business partner. Therefore I think Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   is the only option we should consider as a sponsor selection. Don't you think so too? Regarding to the music act I can understand why you like to have a well know DJ. But since we're a serious business organization we should consider in letting our business partners know that we understand them and therefore also their culture. I think in this case we should consider a Local Russian band   as the music act. Is there a reason why you would choose a DJ as the music act? Choosing a local Russian cuisine  is probably the best way to show them the appreciation and the sincerity as well. I think it's also more suitable for the type of persons that are attending this event. Regarding the catering I was wondering if there is any particular reason for you why you would to choose a buffet? I guess we can talk about the division for the Presentation Tasks   when we figured out the points above.   I hope the decisions I made are reasonable for you. If you have any questions just tell me. With best regards Chris
Dear Chris,   it is great hearing from you. Thank you very much for your counteroffer.   Commenting on your aspects of the counteroffer, I would like to explain my points more detailed.   1.) I absolutely agree your first point having the conference at week 3.    2.) I understand your point of view for choosing Boomerang. However, Art Inc. is already a loyal and trustworthy business partner we have worked with for a long time and I am sure that their support will continue in future. By choosing Boomerang as the main sponsor, we might loose Art Inc as an important partner. Thus, even Boomerang offered directly a long-term contract, I would still stick with Art Inc. and if needed we still can talk to the representative of Art Inc. and ask them specifically if they are also willing to support us in future events. Therefore, I would still consider Art Inc. as the main sponsor.   3.)Yes, there is a reason why I would choose a DJ. I noticed an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the musics acts at ISA events. Since the actors at the previous events were usually unpopular and did not meet everyone's music taste, I think it is very important to have a well-known DJ or band at the event. Especially because there will be a lot of young people (students)who are more interested in listening to a famous performer than to an unknown local Russian band. We can talk to the DJ that he should also play some Russian music so that the musical cultural aspect will be included in the event. If you think a DJ is not professional enough or doubt the appropiatness of this choice of music act, I think the pop band FreeLife which also can play Russian music would be a great opportunity to meet both the business partner's taste and students' tase. Therefore, by considering your aspect, I would choose the Pop Band FreeLife.   4.) I chose the international buffet because I think an international buffet meets everyone's taste. We can still provide local Russian meals as a part of the buffet. But since it will be an international event and people from all over the world will be attending the event, it is highly important to provide decent food that meets everyone's taste. What if the Chinese or Australian people do not like the local Russian food? That would be a disaster having hungry and unsatisfied guests.    I hope hearing from you soon.   Thanks!   Best,    Alex  
Hi Alex, first of all I'm sorry for replying so late. I can see there are still a lot of things we have to discuss. So I guess the things we still need to figure out: Catering: local Russian cuisine   Music Act: Local Russian band   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris First of all I want to make clear since this event will reflect what we as a company are. Therefore we the keynote should reflect that aswell. And I worry the offer you gave me does not show that. So I saw your offer and also why you've choosen the respectiv options. But I I think there are several things mentionet by which I'm pretty sure we do not know if that's the case.   1. Music Act: Local Russian band   You wrote there is a increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the musics acts at ISA events  I don't think we do not  know if that's the case. I also haven't heard of any complains. I also like to mention that a worl famous DJ like Happy is also probably very expensive. Not to mention a DJ with is reputation will easily overshadow the fact that the event is for bonding with the locals. You should also keep in mind event is not for  young people (students) It is more for the representativs that will attend the event. Since I don't have any knowledge on the Pop Band FreeLife I'm not feeling to well booking them.  2.  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Its nice to hear you do understand my point of view, but still I think Boomerang is the choice we should make. I think this point is the one with the most value. I see that Art Inc. has been a partner of us for quite a while and Boomerang has been not. The problem is, we do not know what the future relationship with Art inc. will be. On the other hand we would actually get a contract that will assure us the future wellbeing of upcomming ISA events.   3.  Catering: local Russian cuisine   I think a buffet would is not suiteable for a formal event like that. I guess having local cuisine within the buffet is not an option.  Also I think the important people that will be there expect some kind of professionalism which a buffet clearly does not show. I also think that the majority of people are representitivs from russian companies.    4.  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   This division would be fine if you would choose Boomerang as an sponser in exchange.    With best regards Chris
"Dear Chris,   thank you very much for your response. I really appreciate your message and counteroffer. Excuse me I could not understand what you meant by ""I want to make clear since this event will reflect what we as a company are""? Regarding the music act, I did notice for sure that the guests were highly dissatisfied with the music acts at the previous ISA events. I know it is the opening of a new ISA office in Moscow, but you still need to consider that it is an international event where people come from all over the world. Having a local Russian band would not satisfy everyone's music taste. Since we do not know our budget for the event, it should not matter how much the DJ will cost. Since you do not feel comfortable booking the pop band, I would go with the famous DJ Happy. If you really believe that Boomerang is the best choice, even in the consideration of loosing our best and most trustful business partner Art Inc, I will agree with choosing Boomerang if you go with the international buffet. I do not agree that an international buffet is unprofessional. Because a conference is supposed to be an event where people connect and build relationships which is very important for ISA in order to increase the overall organisation success, people should be able to move around and talk to each other while eating. Having a buffet enables this very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere which is necessary for this event. Regarding the presenation tasks, I guess we still can talk when we have an agreement of the other issues. I would also like to mention that I am out the whole Friday and will not be able to negotiate since I will not have internet access. Therefore, I would really appreciate if we get a deal by Thursday night.   I look forward to your response. Thanks! Best regards, Alex"
Dear Alex, thanks for your meet regarding the selection of our sponsor. So I guess we can say the follwoing points are now decided. Date of Conference: Week 3   Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   So I would like to make a counteroffer regarding the music act. I'm willing to take sacrefices in choosing the catering when we could consider a local russian band as music act.  With best regards Chris    
"Dear Chris, thank you for your concession. I think you did mean the international buffet but selected ""International three meal course"". So I assume you are fine with the catering having an international buffet.  Why are you still against having DJ Happy as the music act? What if we choose DJ Happy and you are going to held the speech and I hand over the awards? Thanks! Warmest regards, Alex   Alex"
Dear Alex, so I think where both not getting exactly what we want. So how about the following compromise: 1. Catering   Since I'm fine with the idea of having international food I'm willing to accept a  International three course meal . I think regarding of the formaility of the event it is more suitable for the event to go with a three course meal. 2. Music Act  I actually still think the choosing a local russian act would be the most suitable option but in order the get an agreement I would be willing to compromise on the band FreeLife . 3. Presentation Tasks     Regarding the compromisses I've taken with point 1 and 2 I think it is fair to say that the presentation task will be set like this Speech by Chris and awards by Alex . All the points I didn't mentionet should stay the same  like in the last offer. With best regards Chris
Dear Chris, thank you very much for your response. I am very glad that you took the step and accepted my compromise having the FreeLife Band as our music act. I am confident that is a great choice. Well, since you would like to make the speech, I will accept your offer regarding the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   if we decide to take the international buffet because I still do not think a three course meal is appropiate for our event. I hope these decisions are convincing and we are going to have an agreement with all the points. I look forward to your acceptance of my offer. Warmest regards, Alex
Dear Alex, regarding  the Catering  why do you think a International  three course meal is inappropriate? I think a buffet is inappropriate since a buffet does not reflect a high class company. This is due to the fact that a buffet will always gives you the feeling that like dining at a canteen. Alos most high ranked persons expect a certain level of exclusivity. With best regards Chris
Dear Chris, thank you for your response. People can decide by themselves what they want to eat if we offer them an international buffet. Additionally, the conference should have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances which requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. Having a very formal three course meal where everbody sits down for several hours with the same people goes completely against that idea. Do you not agree with that? I look foward to your acceptance of my offer. Thanks! Warmest regards, Alex
Dear Alex, thank you for the response. Now I can understand why you choosed the buffet.  Even though I still don't like it I think further negotiation would not be any kind of productive. So I accept your last offer. So thank you for negotiating with me. With best regards Chris
Dear Chris, This is what seems like a perfect conference to me. Please let me know what changes you would prefer. I am very looking forward to a successful negotiation and a great conference. Yours sincerely Alex
Dear Alex, I'm also looking forward to work together with you. Furthermore thanks for your suggestions but I have some part I want to discuss about Firstly I think we should integrate the Russian culture more into our program because it's the first office we open in Russia. The next point is that we should take the opportunity and choose the sponsor which offer us a long term agreement. I'mI'm looking forward to your answer. Thanks and kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I fear that a lot of our guests won't like the russian food. I have to insist on a more international character here. But I see why you prefer Boomerang as the sponsor, so I propose a compromise: We can take  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  and therefore  Catering: International buffet. For the same reason I prefer a more international Music Act. I don't think the local russian band will fit the taste of our audience. Maybe we can compromise on  Music Act: FreeLife. Or do you think this is even worse than DJ Happy? Best Regards Alex  
Dear Alex, Thanks for your fast response. I understand your point of view but I think we should have at least one point where we focus on the russian culture. Your objection regarding the russian food sounds plausible so it would be best if we compromise on Music Act: Local Russian band . I must confess that I feel really uncomfortable concerning your food choise. My experiences with the business contacts and their interests have shown me, that they expect at least a three course meal. Yours sincerely, Chris
Dear Chris, I understand your idea of showing our integration of Russia by bringing some parts of the Russian culture into our conference. I agree that we can find a compromise between Catering and Music Act. But if you pick what is in your opinion the best for the Music Act, I want to pick Catering. And here I think it's best to have a buffet during which you would be free to move around and talk while eating. It would be much more relaxed. So a deal with Catering: International buffet and Music Act: Local Russian bandseems fair to me. However, I was at first offering a compromise between Sponsor and Catering, which makes less sense than the current one of course, but anyway that one is bygone now. And as I think you already have your best case for 3 out of the 5 items in my current offer, I have put  Sponsor Selection back to Art Inc. I really think they are the better choice. They have supported the ISA for a long time and therefore I am sure that their support will continue in the future ï¿½ unless they change their mind, which I think is rather unprobable unless you donï¿½t give them a good reason for it, like selecting Boomerang. Best Regards Alex
Dear Alex, Thanks for your understanding, especially because the success of the ISA has always been partly due to a cultural integration. Nevertheless, Iï¿½m still not happy with your food choice. Like I said before, the international business people (especially the Russians) expect at least a three course meal. Anything less than that would be a decline from the conferences over the last few years and it wouldnï¿½t appreciate the 40th anniversary. So I hope you may think about this part once more. Sadly, I can't agree on Art Inc. as the sponsor. You are right that they are supported ISA for a long time but without any written contract it is a factor of uncertainty. Regarding the current economic situation we should prefer a long-term agreement (especially if the offer is only slightly less than Art Inc.). Thereby the financial situation of ISA is safe for the upcoming years and this should be our main aspect. So I hope you may think about my objection and we could discuss about these two topics once more in order to get to a satisfactory solution for us both. We shouldnï¿½t forget that the main goal is an unforgettable anniversary. Thanks and kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, As far as I see this, you wrote a lot, but what you did is, you made the same offer as before again and this is not how negotiating works for me, so please think about my concerns and try to offer me concrete compromises. What I can offer you is  Music Act: Local Russian band  in exchange for  Catering: International buffet. Or if we totally integrate the russian culture then I want Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. and  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris. I hope any of those 2 alternatives is acceptable for you. If not please make another offer. We need to come closer to a solution. thank you and kind regards Alex    
Dear Alex, Your right, negotiation is based on compromises and understanding. I hoped I could show you the benefits and reasons for my thoughts. But as I can now see, we are two different in our point of view so it is like you said: we need to find concrete compromises. For me your second alternative sounds good. I like the idea of totally integrating the Russian cultur so I'm willing to accept your suggestion regarding the Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  and Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris. I hope now we find a satisfactory solution for us both? Thanks and kind regards, Chris
Dear Chris, thanks for understanding. I think we found an agreement here. Farewell Alex
Hello Chris, as we havenï¿½t met before I shortly want to introduce myself. My name is Alex and I joined the ISA as a student member in 2009 when I started my studies. I already have some experience in planning and organising events which were quite succesful. So I think that I can share some good input for the planning regarding what people expect from such events. I am very excited to work with you and I hope we will find a good solution as we both have the same aim - to win this competition. Enclosed please find my offer. If you have any other interest just tell me, then we can discuss it. I am sure we can find a good solution for both of us. Best, Alex
Dear Alex, Thank you for your fist offer, I think we will do a great job in planning the 40th anniversary event of ISA and beat the other teams. I will also shortly introduce myself. My name is Chris and I joined the ISA in 2010 as a part of my student internship. Now I am organizing internships for other students and therefore have gained knowledge about these business contacts and their cultural background. It is a pleasure to work with you and I think we can learn much form each other. We are both interested in doing a perfect job. I fully agree with you that the date of conference will be perfect in the third week, so I accept this point. I am also willing that you hold the opening speech, because you told me that you have a lot of experience with this. I hope you see that I am very opposed to you and therefore I would like to receive a concession for my part, too. For me the Sponsor Selection is very important: the sponsor Boomerang will be a long-term business partner of ISA and they will give us the sponsoring of future events, therefore it would be nice to give them contract. Because of my work with the business contacts and the known background I would prefer to have a Local Russian Band as Music Act and also a Local Russian cuisine as Catering. The Russian business guests will be enthusiastic and esteemed of this cultural assembling. And for such an event a buffet is not really appropriated. I look forward toyourassessment. Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, thank you for your last message. After some reflections on your last offer, I think it is necessary to make some alterations in order to get on in this negotiation. First, thank you very much for you accomondation regarding the date and the presentation task. Therefore I would accept your Sponsor Selection of Boomerang - although the Sponsor Selection was really very important for me to be Art Inc. Because they have supported the ISA for a long time and therefore I am sure that their support will continue in the future ï¿½ unless they change their mind, which I deem improbable in case we donï¿½t give them a good reason for it. Selecting Boomerang ï¿½ a direct competitor of Art Inc. ï¿½ could be such a reason and consequently I would definitely prefer Art Inc. But as I said - I would accomodate you a lot with this acception. Therefore I would like to receive a concession for my part, too. Over the last years, I noticed an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts at the ISA events. Therefore, I think that some currently famous international act would be exactly the right thing to attract the kind of dynamic guests the ISA is looking for. DJ Happy is a very famous performer, who would be perfect for this event. This DJ regularly fills huge venues with his events and I am sure that his presence will attract many guests, which could then in turn be interested in the ISA. Having a local band play at such an event, however, does not fit the character of an international associationï¿½s meeting. Furthermore, the conference should have an atmosphere to facilitate networking and make new acquaintances which, in my opinion, requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. Having a buffet during which you would be free to move around and talk while eating would be much more relaxed. And since many of the guests are probably unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine, I think it would be smarter to have some kind of international mixture where everybody is able to find something they like. I am looking forward to your answer. With best wishes, Alex
Hello Alex, Thank you for your last message. I really appreciate your concession to my last offer. I think with the Sponsor Boomerang ISA has better future perspectives and they will have a sure financial background for the upcoming years. And Art Inc. donated a lot of money for different events, besides ISA, so the future would be undetermined. I hope I could give you a better feeling with this information. Unfortunately there are still a few open points that I cannot accept and have to be renegotiated. For me the music act is an easy way to show ISAï¿½s interest in the Russian culture and therefore having a local Russian band would establish a good relationship with also local companies, officials and students. For me DJ Happy is not a really good opinion, because it is distracting attention from the ISA event towards the music act. I donï¿½t know how advantageous it would be for ISA only being a ï¿½side-actï¿½ at its own event. The next point we have to talk about is the catering. A local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. I expect many important people to be at our event, who expect a certain level of formality. And in addition to this, anything less than a three course meal would be a decline from the conferences over the last years, which werenï¿½t so special events like the upcoming 40th anniversary. Thus could harm the prestige of ISA. A buffet is more suited to an international and local ISA event without any marketing purposes. But in fact that we already have a Russian music act my suggestion is an international three course meal. I still think that we are the best team. And I hope you find something in my suggestions that accommodates you. All the best, Chris
Hello Chris, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, I cannot agree with all your claims. Your last offer showed me your interest in that cooperation due to the concessions you made. To show you my interest and in order to find a result for both of us, I am willing to give you some concessions, too. I would offer you a compromise concerning the music act. With the band FreeLife you could also establish a good relationship with local companies. This would not be in my interest, but I would accomodate you with this offer. Therefore it is really important for me that we have an international buffet. This point is really important for me. Since this is an international event it would be a disaster if most of the guests are not able to eat the russian cuisine.  I let you choose the sponsor Boomerang although it was very important for me too, that we choose Art Inc. But I accomodate you because you told me that it was very important for you. So I hope you could accomodate me in this point with the international buffet. I am looking forward to hear from you soon. Best, Alex
Hey Alex, Thank you for your last message. Your latest offer was not really accommodating, so I hope there is still a possible negotiation result for both of us. I am really sorry but I cannot accept the music act Free Life because for me it is nearly as bad as DJ Happy and I would not like to have one of them in event. The only thing I can admit to you is the international buffet in order that you accept my proposal with the Russian band. I think we should come to a fair and nice solution with this offer. Greetings, Chris
Hello Chris, I am happy to accept your last offer. I think that we will do a great job with our compromise. Have a good day! Best, Alex
Hello Chris,  mydetailed offer is listed below : - Catering: International buffet   - Date of Conference: Week 4   - Music Act: FreeLife   - Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   - Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   Kind regards,  Alex
Hello Alex,  I think Week 3 is a better option because in this week are no other events and there is also longer time to christmas. So the most people could participate in this week.  Furthermore I think we should take a Local Russian band to show our new partners and our potential partners that we appriciate them. This is very important with regard to the faild attempt to establish an office in Moscow in 2004. With the Russian band we are able to show our commitment to our new office and also we can show our partners from other countries a part of the russian culture, which is very important due to the fact that the event takes place in Saint Petersburg. Due to my enormous experience within ISA, by my voluntary work and my engagement over the last years and also due to my profound knowledge about the business contacts I think I should make the speech at the opening ceremony. You could announce the winners which is also a great opportunity.   Thinking about the sponsor Boomerang is the better chice in my oppinion. With this sponsor we can secure the financial situation of future events of ISA. I think we should not only note the present event, the future of ISA is also very important. Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris, thank you for your answer. I've thought about your deal. In my opinion, Art Inc. made the best offer in terms of a short-term payment directly for the event. Boomerang also made a very good offer, but offered slightly less money for the event. Boomerrang said that they would be willing to sign, but its not certain that they sign. Of course, the future is important, but with more money we can make the event better and more beautiful and thus attract many donations and supporters.    I think that some currently famous international act would be exactly the right thing to attract the kind of dynamic guests the ISA is looking for. I immediately thought of DJ Happy, a very famous performer, who would be perfect for this event. I would insist on Arc Inc. and DJ Happy. In return, we agree on 3 weeks and you make the speech at the opening ceremony and I announce the winners.   Kind regards, Alex
Hello Alex,  althoug I think a Local Russian band would be a better choice, because a show act with such a big reputation as DJ Happy could overshadow the reputation of the ISA, we could choose DJ Happy. But to show our appreciation to our new Russian partners and to be able to acquire more new Russian patners we should have at least one Russian aspekt in the event. So I would suggest so have a Local Russian cusine.  We can agree an DJ Happy and Art Inc., when we have a Local Russian cusine. Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris, in this case i would prefer the international buffet. To show our appreciation we can choose a local russian band.  Kind regards, Alex
Hello Alex,  I though about the event, wich is the 40th anniversary again. For this festive event a International three couse meal would be appropiate to duly celebrate the 40th anniversary. So in my oppinion the International three course meal fits the event better than the International buffet. Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris, I am surprised that you change your mind about the catering. In my opinion, the conference requires a very relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. Having a very formal three course meal where everybody sits down for several hours with the same people goes completely against that idea.  Please think about my last counteroffer again. So we can agree. Kind regards Alex
Hello Alex, I see your point, but I think a International three course meal would fit the event better. I expect many inmptant people to be there who expect a certain menu and not some kind of buffet. Futhermore I think a buffet would be a decline from the conferences over the last years, which werenï¿½t even some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversary and thus would harm the prestige of the ISA. In my oppinion having a buffet suits more to an internal and local ISA event without any marketing pruposes. The participants of the event will have enough time to get in contact with each other before and after the three course meal in an easy-going atmosphare. I think a three course menu would underline the festive and importance of the event. Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris, we can agree on  Catering: local Russian cuisine   Kind regards Alex
Hello Chris, we already settled some issues but there are still some aspects unresolved. As you know the planning of the anniversary event goes to the team with the best concept. Hence I really like to work with you together. Let us start with the presentation task. I know that you have more experience than me, since you joined the ISA in 2005. But therefore you already have good relationships to different business partners. So is it ok for you when I hold the opening speech and you do the announcement of the yearly ISA award winner? Furthermore you already know the most persons better than me regarding to your experience. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   The next topic I want to talk about is the music act. ISA stands for internationality and is focusing on students' interests and needs. Therefore I would suggest that we take DJ Happy. Moreover, I noticed that over the last years there was an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music act. DJ Happy is a very famous performer and stands for dynamic music as the ISA and its members do. Hence I can't think of a better choice. We really have to care about our students who are the future for the ISA. Attracting the students means attracting the business. Music Act: DJ Happy   I hope you agree with my opinion :) Kind regards Alex  
Hey Alex, hope you are doing fine and you had a good start to the week. Great to hear from you and thanks for your first suggestions, but I think we have to reconsider them, as we both want to create a unique and stunning 40th anniversary. First at all ISA is a worldwide organisation with 30,00 members and 20 different nationalities. We are all united by one goal, to gain leadership experience and participate in the development of the association. This is what unites us and we are all proud of being part of this community. Our members are openminded, they long for new experiences and push their personal development by getting to know members and Business Partners from different countries and other nationalities and cultures.  Due to the fact, that this year's celebration will take place in Saint Petersburg, Russia  we should use this great advantage and make it possible for our members to experience the Russian culture. Therefore, I suggest that we should hire a local Russian band as the busic act instead of DJ Happy, who performes at many discos and is therefore not suitable for our event. We celebrate out 40th anniversary, but the point of holding a conference is a great issue and we don't want to overshade th reputation of the ISA. The local Russian band is also widly known in Russia and a famous and popular band there. An other reason for the Russian band is, that many important public figures and business people from Russia will be present at the event and they will appretiate it, if local music is beeing played. I am sure, with this choose our members, as well as the Bussiness Partners will be realy happy and we will have a great evening. Music Act: Local Russian band   Concerning the vision of ISA and the circumstance, that a lot of important people will be present at this day I suggest local Russian cusine as our catering option. We definately have to serve a three course meal as our partners expect a certain level of formality and due to my previous experience with our Business Partners I know that they reject having a buffet, as it is inappropriate for such an event and the quality of the food is mostly very bad, too.  Catering: local Russian cuisine  Concerning thePresentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  I could go with you, although I thing that due to my previous experience and my connections to our Business Partners it would be better, if I would hold the speech and you would do the award ceremony. But in case of an agreement on that I am sure, that we will also finde a solution for the other issues. Have a nice day and we will hear of each other soon. Many greetings, Chris
  Hey Chris,   Thanks for your response.   Iï¿½ m fine, thank you. I also hope that your week is doing well.   I read your suggestions and I get your points but I cannot completely agree on it. As you said ISA is a student association which takes place all over the world. Hence it is managed by young open minded people for young people. In my opinion the choice of a local Russian band does not show that we are an international association.   I know that we established a subsidiary in Saint Petersburg but isnï¿½t the celebration of the 40th anniversary more important in your opinion, too?   Hence DJ Happy who is a very famous performer and is known all over the world will attract many guests and also shows perfectly that we are an international association. In addition, who says that only Russian people will join the celebration? It is the ISAï¿½s 40th anniversary therefore many people from different countries will take place. Therefore we need an international actor in my opinion. Furthermore, the more guests (especially students) we attract the more guests will get in contact with the ISA. If I would be a Russian student who wants to join the ISA then I would do it because it is an international organization where I expect to experience something new (regarding to the internationality). I would be disappointed if I can only see and experience things which I already know. Music Act: DJ Happy       What I mentioned for the music act is also important for the catering. Therefore I suggest an international buffet. This kind of catering produces a relaxed and easy-going atmosphere. This is perfect for all the new people who want to make new acquaintances. It also reflects our open minded manner well because of the wide variety of food. Moreover in the buffet you can also take in account the local Russian cuisine. In addition a buffet can also be from high quality and we save a lot of money because we do not have to pay the waiters.   You may be right that our business partner expect a more formal meal but please do not forget that our first and foremost objective is to care about our roots which mean that we are a student organization. Please think twice of my proposal. Catering: International buffet       What would you say is the best date to hold the conference?   I suggest week 3 because in week 1 there is one of the biggest business conferences in Russia. In week 2 our organizationï¿½s vice president and other higher ranked members are unavailable. Hence it is not a good idea to hold the conference there. Week 4 is very close to the Christmas holidays and therefore most of the people will be unavailable because of preparing Christmas. Week 5 is right around Christmas and this is the worst option in my opinion. Date of Conference: Week 3       Our last open aspect goes about the sponsor selection. What do you prefer?   I prefer Art Inc. The reasons are that Art Inc. offered the highest short-term payment. Moreover, they are willing to sign a long-term contract. Hence this contract provides financial security for several upcoming ISA events and also some growth of the ISA itself. My last point is that Art Inc. is a long term partner and as I heard we always had a good relationship with them. Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.       Concerning our last point:   I appreciate it a lot that you would let me hold the speech.     I hope that you have nearly the same opinion like me.   Have a nice evening and I hope to hear from you soon.     Sincerely   Alex  
Hi Alex, thank you for your message. I appreciate your argumentation. I want to be honest to you: You have your goals you want to achieve and I have mine. It is impossible to work a solution out where you and I achieve 100%. Under these circumstances the only logical approach is to stop arguing and start negotiating. I suggest we save a lot of your as well as my time by tightly negotiating. This will only be effective if both parties make concessions and in return receive concessions.   My first and second concession is: I accept that you make the opening speech, although I think that I am more suitable for this task due to my previous experience. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   In addition I will accept week 3 as the date of conference, even though I prefer week 5. Date of Conference: Week 3   In exchange for my first and second concession I demand the Local Russian band as our Music Act.  Music Act: Local Russian band     Furthermore my third concession is: I accept Art Inc. as our sponsor, although Boomerang would be the much better choice for ISA's future.  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   In exchange for my third concession I expect you to accept Local Russian cuisine for our catering.  Catering: local Russian cuisine   To sum my counteroffer up, I record that I make 3 concessions in total to you whereas I only request 2 concessions from you. The reason for my generously goodwill is the fact, that time is a valuable good you and I should take into consideration and not waste during endless argumentation. This is why I seek a quick agreement. But please be aware, that I will not be able to maintain such goodwill over several rounds of negotiation.    I hope the presentation of my counteroffer meets your expectations. If you need a detailed argumentation for my counteroffer I will gladly deliver it in addition. I hope you can see my courtesy and appreciate my counteroffer.   Have a nice evening. Best regards Chris
Hi Chris, thank you for your message an suggestions. In my opinion we have to argue otherwise there canï¿½t be a negotiation. I tried to convince you from my suggestions because I think that this is the best selection to achieve an unforgettable anniversary for the ISA. It should not be about give and take it should be more about to find the best solution for the anniversary celebration. Hence our individually concerns should not be the crucial factor. So my new suggestions are: In case that for you ï¿½week 5ï¿½ is that much better and you prefer it we can take week 5. Due to the fact that it is right around Christmas I would not prefer it. But if you think that this time is much better for our guests we can take it. Date of Conference: Week 5   On the other hand the catering is an important point for me as I mentioned in the last e-mail (International buffet). With this catering style our students and business partners can make new acquaintances easily. This would be the best for all involved parties. Catering: International buffet   If we show our internationality with the food and therefore being an open minded host I can agree that we than take the local Russian band. This would fit best because on the one side we celebrate the anniversary (international) and on the other side there is the new establishment of the subsidiary (Russia). Music Act: Local Russian band   Please think about my counteroffer. I wish you a nice evening. Alex
Hi Alex, nice to hear from you. I totally agree with you, that our primary goal is to achieve an unforgettable conference, 40th anniversary for ISA and establishing our new subsidiary in Russia. The objectives I follow serve only the goal to create an unforgettable evening for our members of ISA and business partners as well as attracting new oneï¿½s. I think we are on a good way for a great concept for the upcoming event, which we can submit to Dr. Illenschitz. We still have to negotiate about one or two issues and we both know, that compromises are essential.   I am willing to accept your offer to have an International buffet, but in that case I will have to insist on having Boomerang as our sponsor. To make your decision per Boomerang easier for you, I comply with your request to hold the event in ï¿½week 3ï¿½. Catering: International buffet  Date of Conference: Week 3   From our last meetings with Boomerang and Art Inc. we both know, that only Boomerang is willing to sign a long-term contract, which provides financial security, enables the extension for the ISA and ensures the sponsoring of future events. Art Inc. emphasized several times, that they are not able to make a contract with ISA under these conditions. I please you to check your documents on this topic again. If necessary I can send you the corresponding protocol. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   To sum all our negotiation issues up: We already agreed on Music Act: Local Russian band as well as on Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  . Now I will offer you week three as date of conference as well as the International buffet for our catering option. This means I come after your request in Presentation Tasks, Date of Conference and Catering.   I'm sure that both of us are be satisfied with my counteroffer and you will accept it. With this offer we will achieve together the best possible outcome for our common concept for the event. Best regards Chris
Hi Chris,  nice to hear from you. I appreciate your counteroffer and the work with you a lot. The planning of the event is on the home stretch. I agree with you in most of the points. Only the argumentation for the sponsor selection is a little bit weird. From our last meetings with the sponsors I noted that Art Inc. made the best offer for paying the event. As well as they sign the long-term contract, too. I completely agree with you that we need a long-term contract to ensure the future growth of ISA. Furthermore, we always had a good relationship with Art Inc. and I donï¿½t want to lose them as our best sponsor. Boomerang is the direct competitor of Art Inc. and I think that it is not good if we take them as the sponsor for such a big event. If we do that, I think that we will lose Art Inc. as our best sponsor in the future.   Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   As you mentioned in the very beginning of our negotiation that you are more experienced by holding a speech, I now think twice that it would be better if you hold the opening speech for such a big event. Moreover you now our partner better than I do. Hence your speech will be more personal what is important in my opinion.   Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex   I hope that you also agree on that and that we can submit our perfect planning of the event to Dr. Illenschitz. Kind regards Alex
Hello Alex,   thank for your reply, but I cannot accept your offer for 2 reasons:   First, we already agreed on the issue, that you are going to hold the speech and I the awarding. I think that it is very important that you can rely on your negotiating partner and he doesnï¿½t change out of nothing his mind. I already started preparing the awarding and got into action with the responsible member. Therefore I think, that we should not change our settled decision.   Second, as you completely agree with me on the point, that we definitely need a long-term contract with our sponsor the only possible choice is Boomerang. Art Inc. is not guaranteeing this and is only able to offer us a short-term contract, as they have financial difficulties at the moment. Furthermore Boomerang is going to offer a lot of internships for our students in the future. You say, that Art Inc. also offers a long-term contract, but as I already told you last, this is not true. The report of our last meeting shows this, too. I donï¿½t know from where you have your wrong information, but I contacted our finance agent and he confirmed this aspect.   Therefore I hold on to my previous counteroffer, as we are going to achieve the best possible outcome for ISA in that way. Letï¿½s be a team, let us hand in this great concept, win the competition and create an unforgettable event, where we can gain a lot of new experience.   Best regards, Chris
Hi Chris, ok then let us hand our plan in. Kind regards Alex
"Hello Chris! We are both members of ISA for a long time. I have good experiences in planning and organising smaller events. They always turn out very successful. But I have notices, that satisfaction of the pople on the events is by every event worse. I see that dissatisfaction is increasing and therefore I would like to change and make a proposal of things regarding to our event. I am writing to you because we are planning this anniversary event together and these open issues are stil unresolved. As I said I have noticed that dissatisfaction is increasing and therefore I would like to change the music art of this event. It is a big and also very important event for ISA and I think, we should also consider new music art for this event and make event successful and make and have more satisfied quests. With my experience, knowledge and a research I think it would be the best to have for this event currently famous international and populal performer DJ Happy. He (DJ Happy) is currently very popular and his presence would incite many quests and also do a good ""promotion"" for ISA. Second thing that I would like to resolve is catering. It would be good to get our quests talking and to make the environment and atmosphere that allow and facilitate networking. That is good so our students and also quests get to know each other better and to share their experience, brainstorm, therefore we need more relaxed and easy going atmosphere. I think a little bit less formal thing would do the thing we are going for. The buffet seems perfect, so people could be free to move around but also talk while eating. Regarding the food, ISA is very international and not so many people know Russian cusine, it would be great to have some kind of international mixture so everybody could find something they like. I don't think that just local specialities would work for such a multi-cultural event. We can include them so people can get to know our Russian cuisine, but we need international mixture of food. Next thing is, that we have to make an exact date of the conference. For the event like this it would be the best if we had all our quests and the biggest business there and also our members of ISA because they are the ones evaluating the concept. We shall not forget our competition as well, and the presence of our members would be a good move on them. It would be not so good to do the event right before Christmas holidays, because many people are waiting for holidays and to relax and they will not be thinking on the event at that time. In my opinion it would be the best for our organisation to do the event in the third week of our timeframe in which the conference should take place. There are also going to be presentation tasks. As we planned there is going to be a speech by the head of the ISA, the head of the newly established Russian subsidiary. Since I have a lot of experiences on events and also with speeches I would like to have a speech in the opening ceremony of the event. By my experience and by the reaction of the public on the previous events I already know what I could say and what new things to mention in the opening speech in our event. Of course I don't want to have all lights on me, so you can make the announcement of this year's award winners. Last issue is due to our sponsors. We have now four offers. I think it would be the best to go with the Art Inc. because he has made the best offer from all four of them and since Art Inc. is our sponsor for longer period of time and we have good experience with them I think they deserve to be prominently displayed with banners around the podium in these event. This is for now all from my side. I also send you the offer of all things mentionet above, so you can see the points. Let me know your opinion so we can agree together what is the best for our team to do and also to make a great presentation and event of the greates ISA organsation.   Best regards, Alex"
Hi Alex! First of all, I want to thank you for your detailed representation of your thoughts regarding the issues of this anniversary. I am very excited about negotiating the various details of an event this big with you and I am sure, that our thoughts and opinions combined will be a fertile soil for an interesting discussion, which is why I am very happy about working together with you. If you are okay with it, I would like to start with discussing the general setup of the event, talking about organisational details afterwards. This maybe leads to us renegotiating certain issues, but I am sure the exchange of thoughts and concepts profits from a more detailled colloquy. Also, I think that we should shift the discussion about the distribution of our tasks during the event - I understand that the speech in the opening ceremony would be a big deal for you, but I would suggest we talk about the issues related directly to ISA first, and do the personal stuff afterwards. Back to the general setting of the event - Russia is a country with an impressive culture. I totally understand your idea, that DJ Happy could help getting attention for our anniversary, but I want to avoid that he becomes the center of attention. Furthermore, I strongly believe that russian culture should be represented in both the Catering as well as in the Music Act we choose. In my opinion, we shouldn't let his event deteriorate to a pure marketing activity. Our guests should remember this as ISAs anniversary and the start of an important russian chapter, not as a great concert of Mr. Happy with a nice buffet. Nevertheless, I appreciate your thoughts about how to improve satisfaction of our guests. I am not completely fixed on the choices suggested in my counter-offer and ready to make concessions here, I am just not completely persuaded by your arguments. From my side, thats it for now - I am looking forward to hearing from you! If you have any questions about my thoughts and opinions, please do not hesitate to ask - I will do the same. Best regards Chris
Hello Chris! Thanks for your feedback! I understand your concerns. And it is all about ISA. It is an importan event for our organisation and also for all of our members. The speech is not personal thing but it is a part of this important event. But if you want to discus other things first it is ok with me. It is easier to resolve things step by step and so we could both get our goals and be the best team. I understand your concerns about DJ Happy. I was expecting this kind of response and reaction. But again it is an anniversary event of ISA and it is not going to be a concert of DJ Happy with a nice buffet. If I can say it is more elite and more classy anniversary event where focus is going to be on our organisation ISA and also our members and business partners... DJ Happy is would be the one enternaining our guessts when speech acts and all formal things are done. I agree with you that Russia is country with impresive coulture, but remember that is also very specific, not all people like it. And ISA is very international, our members and business partners are international so I still believe, that we should go with DJ Happy and also with international food that includes also some classic food and specialties of Russia (maybe international three course meal-so we can have allso Russian food). Focus would still be on event of ISA and DJ Happy is DJ so he can also play some Russian music to represent the country, but also other music so we don't forget our international parters and members (I am sure, that you were on some international event abroad, where music was not the best, because it was local and unknown to you). I understand if you need more time and you're still not completely fixed on you offer, but we also have to send invitations so we need informations about the date of event and also about our Sponsors. I would realy appreciate your point of view on the date of the Conference in the week 3, and also our long time sponsor Art Inc.  Best regards, Alex
Hi Alex, thank you for your reply! You are right - our timefrime for coming to a conclusion is limited and very strict, therefore we should be both deliberate but also decisive. First of all - week 3 seems like the perfect choice for me. Regarding the other four issues - we surely both do have strong opinions. To me, the compromise solutions in most of the issues do not really make sense. I guess it would be better, to completely fullfill some of your and some of my interests. Going with an option that none of us really likes will also be hard to justify if we are asked by the jury of this contest. If we choose some of your ideas and some of mine, that would be quite easy. In order to find the best solution for both of us, it would be great to hear about how important the issues are to you. For example, I would be fine with DJ Happy, if on the other hand the catering was russian cuisine. I am looking forward to your thoughts about this. Best regards Chris
Hello Chris! I am happy that we agreed on the Date on the Conference that should take place in week 3! It is true that we both have strong opinions, but what you wrote next I don't understand completely. If you go with my offer you're interest are not going to be fullfill. And this works also for my side. I really don't want to make choises that will not make us and our team happy. You probably would not like to organize a event with some issues that are not as you want them to be and therefore we could perform really bad. In this case it would be hard to justify our options. Because of that I think it is good, that we both make our opinions and offers clear and talk over them and also find a solution that works for both of us as also it works for our team. I can see, that you are not really happy with the performer DJ Happy. Maybe we can then get the pop band FreeLife which is a little bit less popular than DJ Happy, but could be enough to keep the guests satisfied. They can also perform some Russian music. We are both long in ISA organisaion and so we both know that it is present in 20 countries and with over 30,000 members. That is really a lot and we are really international. So if you are not satisfied with international buffet, then we can do international three course meal, so every one could find something they like. One course of the meal would/could be local Russian cousine, becouse the event is about of strengthening the relationships between stakeholders and also celebration of Russian ISA office. In this case we don't forget our international partners, but also we present and celebrate the Russian ISA office. Since now we agreed on folowing issues: Date of the Conference --> 3 Week We still have to find a solution for folowing issues: Sponsor, Catering, Mucis Act, Presentation Tasks Regarding these unresolved issues I already made my offer clear. Let my know what do you think about them, and also, what do you think about all mentioned above. I would also like to know, if you already decided about your offer regarding unresolved issues (presentation tasks, sponsor selection).   Best regards, Alex
Hi Alex, thank you for your message and your moves towards me - unfortunately, there was a misunderstanding. Both Freelife and the International three course meal seem like stopgaps to me. Do they really make you happy? I'd much rather go with DJ Happy and local russian cuisine then filling the gaps in the event with stuff we both don't really like. Regarding the other two missing issues - I have to admitt that the choice of sponsor is pretty important to me. What Boomerang offers us is more like a partnership, while Art Inc. Seems like a shortsighted decision for money to me. I would be fine with you giving the opening speech if we choose boomerang as sponsor. I hope that my attached offer satisfies your wishes - to me, it is more then just a compromise. Best regards Chris
"Hello Chris! Ok so then, as you said, we can go with DJ Happy. Now we have resolved two issues: date of the conference, music art; We are getting close! Regarding the local Russian cuisine I am really not sure, because we are really international and most of the guests are unfamiliar with the Russian cuisine. Russian cuisine is really specific and not so much people like it. It is now that I wish for, but I try to look from the perspective of our quests and also the reputation of ISA. I realy think it is better to have three course meal to satisfy our guests, and we could also include in one of three course meal also one course of Russian cuisine in it so your interests are included (we can make it so, because I see that Russian cuisine is important for you and like this we also include it as a celebration of new office in Russia). I really can't imagine that just local specialities would work in such a multi-cultural event. We really have to focus on the reputation of ISA and our internationality. We can presend the Russian cuisine in one of three course meal. I repeat in this case we would satisfy our international guests and also include one course meal of Russian cuisine and satisfy your interests.  I really don't look this event based on my and your interests. It is important to me, that we work well as a team and to focus on ISA and the members, guests... I understand that the sponsor like Boomerang would be nice, because as you said they offered a long-term contract, however, we are both working for ISA for long time so you also know that Art Inc. is our sposnor for longer period of time. We have worked with them for quite a while and we have a really good partner relationship with them. And I think that this relationship should be considered in this case when we have to decide which to pick. It is hard because Boomerang offered less money but also a long-term contract, where they could ensure the sponsoring of future events of the ISA. It would provide us also with financial security of several upcoming ISA events and also some extent for ISA as well. However we both know that Boomerang and Art Inc. are competitors. Art Inc., with who we are working with for a longer period of time, really did the best offer, even if he offered a short-term payment directly for this event. But as we are working together and we have a good business relationship and based on the past experiance I am sure, that their support will continue in the future. Even if they gave us short-term offer for this event, I believe that their support will continue in the future as we could also see that in the past events and by offers by Art Inc. As I said in the first message to you, we are working with them (Art Inc.) for a long time and they have been supporting us for all of this period and I really think, that we should consider this business relationship and that they really deserve that we prominently desplay them with banners around the podium on this event. I think it is not fair, that we forget about our sponsor that is with us for long period of time, just becouse some other company once made a better offer for us. We also have to think about Boomerang in different way, because we still don't know the company very well and it is going to take a long time to build the relationship as we already have with Art Inc. Building business relationship really take a long of time and we still don't know if new company would suit our priorities. Again I would like to say, that I would like to make this event in the way it suits ISA and to make our team good, and our guests and members satisfied. I would like to have event, that our team is satisfied with and also you and me are happy with the choises we made (not regarding just our interest, but focused also on our members). Every message that I have recieved from you, were like if we go with your wish, then other one is mine... I really think that this kind of act is more focused on us and our interests and not so much on the team performance and event it self. So I would really appreciate, if you think over the things and issues that I mentioned above and to keep in mind also the ISA, members and event itself and not just to be focused on our interests. Also regarding your previous messages, you just said that if I go with something you want, I can have a speech. And recording to that I have a feeling that  the speech ceremony is not so important for you. Please corect me if I am wrong. I am looking forward to your answer, so we could make event respectful to ISA, our members and guests. I am hopping that our team is going to make choises that we are all satisfied with, regarding to satisfy also our guests and important members. Best regards Alex"
Hi Alex, I am sure you understand that I am quite disappointed by your last offer. Since the start of our negotiation and your first message, the only concession you made was the International three course meal instead of the International buffet. An International three course meal is a solution I really dislike, it is not really better then the International buffet. I really appreciate your love for ISA, I totally understand that you think your concept would be the best for the organization. I think exactly the same about mine. But after all, this is a contest which only one team can win. Only the best concept will become reality. The first selection criteria is the team performance, not to what degree one of us is able to realize his own ideas. I don't want to start a huge discussion about this negotiation itself, but get back to the main point - coming to a solution which grants us a high joint utility, which will enable us to realize our ideas. First of all, we did not resolve the issue regarding the Music Act. Hiring DJ Happy while offering an international three course meal would make russian culture a side note. I don't think that should be our goal at all. Regarding the Sponsor - Art Inc. indeed supportet us the last years. But nevertheless, when accepting their offer, different then Boomerang, they are not legally bound, exposing us to unneccessary risks. I don't think we should be that short-sighted. Last of all, the speech. Don't get me wrong, this issue is very important for me. But from a rational perspective, I think you and me could hold the speech equally good. Therefore, I would be fine with renouncing. Don't get we wrong. I don't want this to become a One-Man-Show. I just think that we both should focus on a high joint utility instead of making compromises in certain issues just for the sake of it, without really satisfying one of us. This way, we will not achieve a result which will enable us to realize our plans. Please find attached an updated offer. As I see that the International Catering is very important for you and I do not really see a difference between the International buffet and the International three course meal, but I do not want russian culture to become a side note, I think that the International buffet combined with a Local Russian Band could be a good compromise. I am looking forward to your reply. Best regards Chris
Hello Chris! Ok, than I missunderstood you when you wrote to me that you prefer DJ Happy. I would really appreciate if you give your arguments to your offer. Since now you have have send me your offer if I accept something that you would like to have, you will accept mine, but you really didn't make clear how is that important from the view of big picture. Because since we start to organize this event and to discus these unresolved issues, only thing that I get back from you is your offer, without arguments why is it good regarding the ISA and the reputation. I have gave you my offer trying to say in which way it shows interests and priorites of ISA, and also how it goes with your and my interests. As you said it counts team performance so we should look interests of ISA and also ours..I tried to make my offers clear with the arguments, how they go hand in hand with ISA and also my interests, later on when you said I also included your interests in, so it is a win win combination and not just one man show as you said. Again this event is anniversary and I don't think that with the three course meal where we could offer international food and also include Russian cuisine would put Russian on side note but oposite..it could be introduced to our members and guests. If we had just international buffet, we could include all foods and the Russian cuisine would not be so much in attention as it could have been in the international three course meal and that is the difference. I would like to have international three course meal becouse it suits to your interest of Russian cuisine, but also with ISA, becouse it includes other international foods and in this way we can satisfy also our international members and guests on the event. As I said and you also know, Russian cuisine is specific and not so many people like it. Maybe you have been on the event where everything was just focused on one direction and classical food of the country that you didn't like. If we go with the three course meal and with DJ Happy, we send out the message that we appreciate our international members, but that we want to introduce them also the Russian culture. In this case DJ Happy could play cultural songs that are tradition to Russia and also three course meal would be more of the centre and in the attention to Russian cuisine. In this case we higlight Russian culture (food and mucis) as you would like and as we are celebrating also the new office in Russia, but we also don't forget about our members that are from other countries. DJ Happy would be payed by us and so we can agree with him how and what should he play on the event. He would not be in the focus, becouse we have these act speeches and ceremonies, but he would be for the entertainment afterwards and also guests would be satisfied. If we want to have a best concept we have to include everything (Russia and also international members) so I think that DJ Happy and three course meal would do the trick. Regarding the sponsor selection I am really not sure and also not so happy with the Boomerang. I mean as I have said it did give us the offer of long-term contract, but also less money as Art Inc. But I still think that we really have to have in mind this long term partnership that we have with Art Inc. He has been our sponsor for a long time and I truly believe that the financing will continue in the future. We har already a lot of events where Art Inc. didn't make a offer of long-term contract, but latter on he stayed and sponsored us for every event and occasion. So based on pass experience ISA has with them I believe that this financing will continue in the future because of our good business relationship. Building the new business relationship takes time and I don't think that this kind of relationship we have with them for this long is going to wanish just like so. It takes time for us and also for them to find new business partner and to build what we already have. It would be pitty that we loose this kind of partnership with them just based on one offer from other company that we don't know. And if we accept that offer from another company we send out the message that we are willing to stay with one company as long as we have some benefits from them, but soon when we are offered a better offer we forget about everything. And since you are working with business contacts you should know that business relationships like we have with Art Inc. are really important and we should not just throw them away. Again, you said that we could do the speech equaly good but you left the offer like I have a speech and you handle with awards. Is that OK, or you want to make changes? I am looking forwart to your answer, hoping with more arguments to show me your point of view, how does your offer relate with ISA, our international members (both are important for the best concept) and also in our interests.   Best regards, Alex
"Hello Alex, thank you for your fast reply. Please excuse me writing rather short messages. I am very busy and try to say what I want to say with few words. I think I made my opinion about the general setting of the event clear, but please let me state it more detailed. 1. Catering One of the main strengths of ISA has always been the adaption of other cultures. Furthermore, this event could be the first milestone in creating intense relations with business partners in russia. Many Russians, and especially the more wealthy ones, are very proud of their culture. The first impression we create with this event will be substantial for our future success. ISA is all about creating contacts. That's what makes us special. In my opinion, offering our guests an International buffet or International three course meal could prevent starting off with russian business-men and -women. We should really show our appreciation for their culture! And that doesn't mean serving Hamburgers, a Schnitzel and a Wodka Gorbatschow afterwards, saying it a little bit exaggerated. Therefore, an International three course meal isn't really a compromise solution for me - if we choose something ""International"" at all, then we should go with the buffet. At least it makes you happy - I will never think of this as a good solution, but we should't choose something that we both don't really like. 2. Music Act Nearly the same goes with the Music Act. DJ Happy is the Hamburger under the music acts. Letting him play russian songs could be seen as a provocation rather then a appriciation. Furthermore, just because you say that his presence wouldn't overshadow the actual purpose of the event doesn't make that true. You are right in one aspect - we pay him, we tell him what to play. Nevertheless, international top acts, like he is, attract a kind of attention that is less the appropriate for an event like this. I don't want ISA to become a side act of DJ Happy. And I am sure it would be like that, because I witnessed more then just one festival starring him. Once again, we should see this event as an opportunity to give our office in Russia a head start, not as pure marketing! Regarding our ""emergency solution"", Free Life: they are quite ok. But do you really like them? Do you think a pop band (or a DJ) is a sophisticated music act for a business event? I don't think it should be a party. 3. Sponsor Selection I agree with you that we had a really good time with Art Inc. Personally, I would be really happy to see their logo on the banners around the main stage. But please think about why they always donate some money, getting the chance to present their company at our events, but never offer us a long-term contract. Thats because they want flexibility - they will drop us the exact moment appearing on the banners on the main stage isn't beneficial for them any more. In contrast to that, what Boomerang offers us is a partnership - they believe in ISA, as we both do. They want to support us on the long-run. They are not worried about establishing a deep relatitionship. As mentioned in my last E-Mail, only legally bound means legally bound. You have no guarantee, that Art Inc. will sponsor any further ISA events after this one. This is pretty sad, I agree with you, but changing our partner to Boomerang would enable us to plan for the future. The existence of this organisation, whether we can host events this big and create relations, depends on our sponsors to a high degree. I don't think trading in that safety for some dollars would be reasonable. 4. Speech We both know that this issue is personal. An executive assistant position within ISA is at stake. And I'm sure that we both think that who ever does the Speech has the best chances to get this position. In contrast to handing over some awards, the speech is exactly what you want it to be. It is your chance to prove ISA that you can be professional, self-assured and that you are able to manage pressure. Doing the speech would be a great thing - unfortunately, I think that only one of us will get this chance. Sure, we could share the activities - but that would come with high coordination effort. To me, letting you do the speech appears to be a better solution than hiring a third person or to share activities. I would love to do the speech, as it would give me the chance to give the audience an impression about my ideas of ISAs future. But I don't want the negotiation to break down because of that. I hope that I was able to give you a detailled impression of what I think. Nevertheless, our opinions differ substantially in the open issues. Thats fine - I love ""fighting"" with you over these ideas. But, unfortunately, I don't think that one of us will be able to make the other one change his opinion. Some of these opinions have consolidated themselves over years, this can't be changed within just a week. As written earlier, I think that going with the ""radical"" solutions would be better. Why should we choose a solution which is much less beneficial for you while not being any better for you? Tomorrow will be the last day of this negotiation. Then, it will come down to us to find a solution, which is appreciated by both of us and which is fair. Except the Date of the Conference, I left all fields empty in this offer. I hope that, after explaining my opinion in detail, your next offer will differ from your last, your penultimate and your first, which are nearly the same. It would be to bad to waste the chance to organize an event this big. As mentioned, I am willing to make concessions. An event with russian music and international food would be fine for me. We just shouldn't imitate russian culture, possibly offending our future business partners. We should demonstrate that we really appreciate their culture, displaying it in at least one aspect, which is a ""russian original"", not a poor copy. All these strategies behind the chair appear to me like stopgaps. Thats it from my side for now - I am looking forward to your offer. Best regards Chris"
Hello Chris! Thank you for your answer and for your arguments that you wrote! Now you made my life easier! Yes some of my emails were the same, but that is because I didn't really know your thinking and arguments behind your offers and honestly I was also a little bit confused by them. Now that you make your self and your offers with arguments more clear, we can say something more regarding to our unresolved issues. Regarding to Music Art I am still not completely sure about it. I still think that we should have somebody more important and somebody more big. Not in a way of party and concerts, but still it is an anniversary event and some after party will be expected. It is not strictly business but also celebration. Since our members are more international, I think it is better to have someone else than local band. If not somebody big as DJ Happy, than maybee FreeLife band. They are not so big and would not do as much as DJ Happy, but still I think they would make our guests satisfied. Both of them are popular in Russia and also in other countries, so I think our guests would not mind. If you dislike the three course meal where one of the course meal would be Russian cuisine (where we could really nicely introduce the Russian culture) and would rather have international buffet it is fine with me. I was not having in mind hamburgers and other fast food and snaks that you mentioned because it is still, as I said in one of the previous messages, more elite and classy event. It is just to create more easy-going atmosphere where our guests could get the chance to know each other and to talk etc. Regarding the sponsors: As I said it is really hard. On that we both agree. It is hard because Art Inc. is our sponsor and we have good relationship with them. That kind of relationship really needs time to be build. But you made also a clear point. Even if it is hard to pick another sponsor because of the offer and relationship we have, we also have to look a little bit outside of the box. Boomerang really did offer us better offer regarding the contract. It really ensures us financialy and it would help ISA as well. But again we have to consider also this relationships. Since you cooperate the business contacts of ISA you know better than me about business contacts of ours and also their interests. So if you are sure, that going with Boomerang and to build relationship with them with excepting their offer and signe the contract with them that would help ISA now and in the future, than we can go with Boomerang. Regarding the speech it is true, that it would be good for us both. You have mentioned external speaker. Why is it not good for you? Maybe this solution would be fair for both of us, since we both would benefit from the speech. And if you don't want to share the task, maybee it is a good solution. If we look from the other side, this external speaker could be beneficial for ISA and for the event it self. If we have someone important talking about the importance of ISA for the business world would defenetly be worth it. What do you think? I will leave the fields for Presentation tasks, Music Art and the Catering empty, so you can think again, what it would be better. If we have just international buffet we have there mix of food and people may not know exactly from where the food is. If we have three course meal one of the course could be Russian cuisine and in that way we can introduce the culture to the people and even let the Russian people to present it and to say something about it. Best regards Alex
Hi Alex, I feel like we will finally come to a conclusion - nice! Now that we both know exactly about our opinions, the only thing left to do is finding a compromise which encorporates both our thoughts. An International three course meal wouldn't be the best combination, but still slightly better then a buffet. Also, FreeLife wouldn't be the music act of my choice, but I guess this is also about making concessions. After all, I guess I could also live with this combination - and a nice russian main dish, maybe interpreted in a more international way, and a band, which is quite popular, not only in Russia - to me, this seems like an appropriate solution for an event like this. Not the setup I dreamed about - but alright. Regarding the remaining two issues - I really don't think we should give the opportunity to speek in front of such a great audience to a third persons, just because we can't decide who should do it. After this week, hearing your speech would satisfy me more then an uninvolved third person. I am sure you will do the special occasion justice. Regarding Boomerang - its great to hear that you maybe would be fine with choosing them as sponsor. I believe it would be the best solution. Alright - I also noted down these aspects in my offer. I am looking forward to your reply! Best regards Chris  
Hello Chris! Yes it is a lot easier now when we know our opinions and arguments. And as you said we are going to come to a conclusion. Team work is always hard work because we are all different people with different opinions. It is hard that all of our wishes come to a reality. We have to make compromises. There are also some issues that are not as I wished for, but however we have to look what is good for ISA, our members and also what is going to be good for our guests. If I look to your last offer now I think it is good. Sure we all didn't get what we wished for, but I think the choises are in some way with our interests (not 100% but they cover and include some of them) and they fill in good with the ISA priorities. I think that we with this choises could have a concept that represents ISA very good in ways of the priorities and also internationality. I believe that with this choises we can have a good concept on the event and also our team could perform well. I hope that event turns out well and that our guests will be satisfied, also our members and business partners. I think that all our team members will fullfill some of their interests and all will benefit from it. Best regards Alex
Hi Alex Thanks for your reply. I am very happy to hear that. I also think that this could be an appropriate compromise. With the strict limit of one week to decide on issues that important, I think we did quite a good job. Thank you for your time. I really appreciate your work on this and I am sure, if our concept is chosen, we will both work together will full power to make this event what it is meant to be: the best anniversary in ISAs history. A milestone. Once again, thank you. Best regards Chris
Hi Chris, how are you? Here is my offer about the remaining topics for the ISA conference. I would propose not to negotiate every single item but negotiate about multiple issues so that we can cause a win-win for both of us. Regarding the Catering: International buffet  is my preferred one because we don't need an stringent atmosphere like we would have with an international three course meal and a buffet encourages the people to talk with each other. That's really important for networking! In case of  the Date of Conference: Week 3  would be the best. During the first week, the conference would collide with the International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow. In the second week, many high ranked members of ISA are unavailable so this date is really a no-go. Also week four and five are bad because they are near to and during Chistmas. For a good even we need an international Music Act: DJ Happy  would be the best choice because he attracts the dynamic people, ISA is looking for. We also have to speek about the Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  is my preferred constellation. I have dreamed about that for a long time, so I would appreciate it if you would let me do this. Regarding the Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  is the sponsor that we have to choose. Art Inc. made the best offer. They have supported us in the past for a long time and I think their support will also last in the future. So we cannnot annoy them by selecting another sponsor. I hope we can get to a consensus which is good for both of us. I'm looking forward hearing from you. Kind Regards Alex
"Hi Alex, Thank you for your quick offer. I'm fine thank's. How are you? I have to say sadly, that we don't agree in some points. But I'm sure that we can resolve our problems. Regarding the Catering: I think it's a high level of formality on our event with very important peoble. So it's indispensible to have a real menu. The local Russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation. I think a buffet is more suitable for an internal, local ISA event. In the last years I have been on several conferences, compareable with our event. On these conferences was always a menu and the people loved it. Regarding the Music: I agree with you that DJ Happy is a great artist. I saw him on a festival and he was popular to all people there. But I'm afraid that ISA becomes to a ""side-act"". If we choose DJ Happy, we have a great party but we can't build up our relationship to the russian members and guests. I prefer a very gook local russian band. They can also bring a good atmosphere and a lot of fun. About the presentation tasks: This event is also important for me. I'm next to my exam and the job would be a very important chance for me. I have waited for an opportuniy like this so long. Actual I work on a voluntary basis and it is a great dream to earn money with my knowledge I learned in the last years at my work for ISA. So I prefer Speech by Chris and awards by Alex. In reference to our sponsor selection: I prefer Boomerang. Yes, the donate less money but we save the money long-term. In my opinion the people, who evaluate us see, this also positive because we save money for the next events too. If we get an agreement with Art Inc. that they arrange with us a written contract regarding the futur I will agree you. They support us such a long time, so it's a good point in time to make a long-term contract for the futur. In case of the date of the conference I agree with you totally. Week 3 is the best choice.   I think it's very important that the russian members and guest feel comfortable on our event. The sucess of ISA has always been partly due to the partly due the successful adoption of local ulture. This is a vital part of creating a relationship. This is my experience of the last years. I'm sure that we find a good commitment, anyway it's gonna be a great event. Best whises Chris"
Hi Chris, I'm fine, thanks. I think a local russian band does not fit to such an international event. As well the catering and its character is very important. A three course meal is really bad for networking, so a buffet would be perfect. DJ Happy is very famous and international, like our event. So let's find a consensus. Let's take the international buffet and DJ Happy as music act.  Instead I would concede regarding the presentation task, so that you can held the speech and I would also concede regarding the sponsor selection, so that Boomerang will be our sponsor at the event. Would that be suitable for you? Thanks and Regards Markus
Hi Alex, thank you for your counteroffer and your accommodiation. In my opinion DJ Happy is to popular for our event. All the attention will be paid for him and not for our organisation. He will overshadow the whole event. Because of that it's a very bad idea. My favourite is still the local russian band their songs too controversial and it's a save option for us. After that I can life with the desission to take the pop band FreeLife. I have heard that their music is suited to accompany the evening. Regarding to the catering I really think that the local russian cuisine is the best option. It's a good way to get in a conversiation to our guests and it also shows appreciation to our new russian members and guest. In many years of experience I have learnd that this is a very good strategy. I hope that we can come to a conclusion. Thank you for your accomodation. I'm sure that we find an agreement for the last two points. Kind RegardsChris
Hi Chris, thank you for your quick response. Unfortunately I do not aggree with some points you mentioned. Also I'm a little bit disappointed that you did not defer to my try to come to a consensus. We have to talk again about the catering. This event is international. The russian cuisine might be good, but many cultures and countries do not like this kind of cuisine and will be unfamiliar with it. So I think it's clear that it must be international. Also this event should be seen as a networking event, so a buffet would be more preferrable because the people will be on the move and will therefore speak with a lot of different people. Regarding the music act, I think it will be an advantage that DJ Happy is that famous because he will attract that dynamic people, we want to have in our organisation. For the speech act, it would be fair if a third person would do it. You are already a while in the organisation so the members know who you are. But they don't know who I am. For both of us, helding the speech is a great chance to get more popularity but hireing a third person would be the fairest option. So again a try to reach a consensus: Regarding the sponsor selection, I wrote that Boomerang would be OK for me if we take the international buffet for catering. You didn't accept that concession, so another try: Let's take the international buffet as catering and Art Inc. as sponsor. Art Inc. did so much for us in the past and they have also the best offer. Instead, I would aggree on Free Life as music act and I would also aggree that you can do the speech, although this would be a little bit unfair because you are much longer in the organisation. I hope we can come to an agreement. Have a nice evening. Best Regards Alex  
Hi Alex, I'm really worry that I disappointed you because of my counteroffer. Thank you for your honesty. I agree with you that the event is international. So I will make you a good comrise. We make an international buffet but for the russian touch I will get my local russian band. For me it's very important that our russian guests and members have a lot of fun and I think that they are very happy with a russian band, which makes a good mood. I think that's a really good mix between our both interests. After that I would prefer Boomerang still again. It would be great if we find a compromiss between our interests. Have a great day! Best wishes. Chris
Hi Chris, thank you very much for your step towards an agreement! I really appreciate that. I will also come a step vice. Regarding the music act, we should find a middle way. DJ Happy is too famous, I understand that. The local russian band is too unknown for such a big event. We would loose many people which would come to that event with a more famous music act. A middle way would be the band Free Life. This would be a compromise for both of us. Regarding the Sponsor Selection, Art Inc. is really important for our organisation because it is a sponsor which is willing to support our organisation also in the future. But with Boomerang as sponsor, which is a direct competitor to Art Inc., we would lose them as sponsor. But I would accept Boomerang, if I could do the speech act instead. Your are more known in our organisation so for me it would be more beneficial. Is that offer reasonable for you? I hope so. I wish you all the best! Regards Alex
Hi Alex, I would accept all your preferences if I get the Local Russian band. Than you get the Catering and the Presentaton Tasks. I think that we decided half/ half is fair in my opinion.   What do you think? I'm pretty sure that this is the best result. I would prefer if we come to a conclusion till tomorro, because I would really don't like it if we don't come to an solution. I enjoyed our cooperation a lot and I think that this is a really good match.   Have a nice day! Best wishes!   Chris  
Hi Chris, I see the russian band is very important for you. But unfortunately for me it is really a no-go. I would suggest another way. Let's take Free Life as a middle way, which is fine for both of us.  A third person will held the speech, which is also a middle way.  Boomerang will be our new sponsor, which is good for your preferences. That would be also a half/half deal I can agree on. I really enjoyed our negotiation so far and I appreciate your concession. I hope we come to an agreement with this offer. Best Regards Markus
Hi Alex, I will stay online today till 5pm. So we can discuss our differences quite often. I can understand that the local russian band is for you a no go. So what do you think about the International three course meal? I really like to have something international in our event, it helps us to come close to our russian guest. For that you get the speech and FreeLife as Music Act. In my opinion it's a good offer. So we both don't get our favourites in Catering and Music Act and I can life with it because we have an international flair with the Catering. What do you think?   Best wishes Chris
Hi Chris, If the russian band is so important for you, I will accept it. But instead I would preferr Art Inc. as sponsor and you can have the presentation task. So let's try to come to an end. An acceptable offer for me would be the following: Catering: International Buffet Date of Conference: Week 3 Music Act: Local Russian Band Presentation Task: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex Sponsor Selection: Art Inc. I hope that is suitable for you. Best Regards Alex
Hi Alex, this is acceptable for me. Thank you for this negotiation. I enjoyed it and wish you all the best for your future. I appreciated that we have been fair all the time.   All the best for you!   Chris
Hi Chris, is everything fine? So it's our task as part of this year's competition to plan the anniversary event. I think at the beginning we should make some suggestions, so that we can find a good solution for both of us and also for the organisation. For the Catering I think an international buffet would be the best because so everybody is able to find something and it is good for networking in an easy-going atmosphere. The date should be week three, because in this week there are no other events and it is not too close to christmas. As music act I prefer DJ Happy, he would fit to our international atmosphere and our dynamic guests. The regarding the presentation tasks, it would be no problem for me to hold the opening speech. You could do the part with the awards, so it the tasks would be shared between us. At the end, i prefer Art Inc, as sponsor, because they made the highest offer for our event. What do you think about my idea of the anniversary event? Let me know... I'm looking forward to a good and interesting collaboration :) Greetings, Alex
Hey Alex, everything is fine with me so far, I am a little bit excited because of the event which is coming up. I hope you also doing good? First I would like to thank you for time you put into your offer, letï¿½s start with the point where we already match each other. I like the idea of placing the event in week 3, it seems like the ideal point for all the people to focus on our event and nobody has to decide between to events. Moreover as you already mentioned, it is not too close to Christmas and I talked to the Vice President of ISA already and he is also fine with the date. Still there are some points were we have some disagreements and where we could move closer to each other. Due to the fact that this event takes place in Russia, I am not sharing the same opinion with you about catering and the music act. Of course it would be easier for some people to find an appealing meal,  nevertheless I think that our organization, our members and our guest are open minded to have a try for Russian food and believe me itï¿½s great! Moreover I think the Russians guest will really enjoy to find some local food and they will be easier convinced about our organization also care for local interests. The same goes with the music, I think this conference should be having a Russian touch, when it takes place in St. Petersburg. Regarding the two last points (presentation & sponsoring), I would suggest a compromise. I can understand that you would like to hold the main presentation (besides I would also like to do that), thereby you can support your standing in the organization and recommend yourself for important jobs. On the other hand for sponsoring I would select Boomerang instead of Art Inc.. Of course we will receive in the short time view slightly less money, still we will have a long term contract and financially secured for a long time. What do you think of my proposal? I hope we can find a solution which fits both our needs. Would like to hear from you soon. Greetings Chris    
Hi Chris, sorry, I'm a little bit busy at the moment. But I've read your offer and I will send you a new message this evening. Greeting Alex
Hey Alex, first thanks for your mail.  I can understand your situation there is a lot to do at the moment. Still keep in mind that the preperation of the event could be very important for the future from both of us. Nevertheless I am looking forward to your mail tonight! Have a nice day and good look with your other activities. Best regards Chris
Hi Chris, thank you for your proposal. I'm also really looking forward to our opening event. I'm happy that we agree about placing the event in week 3. I also think this is the best date for almost everyone. So we can tick off this point from our list. Let's discuss about the other issues :) The point where I strongly disagree with you is the catering. You mentioned that our organization, our members and guests are open-minded. For that reason alone I think an international buffet would be a great opportunity to show how open-minded our organization is. It would be also no problem to have some russian dishes, but at the same time you have still free choice what to eat. I believe our Russian guests will still enjoy this. Taken as a whole I prefer a buffet during which you would be free to move around and talk while eating. This would be much more relaxed. Where I can accommodate you is with the music. Altough I would still prefer DJ Happy for the same reasons as with the catering, I suggest as an alternative to book FreeLife. They have a broad repertoire of songs and I am sure it will be no problem to ask them if they can play some famous russian songs. I thought a lot about the presentation and the sponsoring. For me it is important to have an appropriate and reliable sponsor for our event. We should consider our good relationship with Art. Inc. and that they have supported us for a long time. So I am sure they will continue their support in the future. However if we select Bommerang as our new sponsor, Art Inc. would probably stop their sponsoring. If we could agree on Art Inc. as our sponsor I am gladly willing to let you hold the opening speech and I am doing the awards. Think about my proposal and I am happy to hear from you soon. I am sure we both find an adequate solution. Greetings Alex
Hey Alex, I have read your offer with great interest, however there are some open points we have to talk about. I can see after your last offer that the buffet is a really important point for you and I think I can make a concession as I understand it is true, the guests can talk more freely with each other. Still considering the music act, I donï¿½t believe Free Life or DJ happy would be a good choice. Luckily I have visited a concert of DJ Happy. As much as I like him personally, I donï¿½t think it would be the best choice for our event. Same goes for FreeLife, I know the youth likes him, but we need a band for our Russian guest which they can identify themselves and the officials and companies wonï¿½t be impressed by pop music, since they like the Russian music I insist on  a local Russian band. For the sponsors I have to say, I know Art Inc. has done a lot for us in the past, but please think rational. Boomerang will sign a long-term contract with our organization. We have to look into the future. The sponsoring of Boomerang will make sure we can hold the next events without thinking too much about money. If we now just sign a contract with Art Inc., they can decide to leave us after this event and we have to look out for another sponsor again, so we will lose time and more important money! Take your time and think about it, I think we are closer to a solution that it seems in the first place! Every mail symbolizes a small step ahead in our negotiation and bring us closer to a successful event! Kind regards chris    
  Hi Chris,   thank you for your refreshing feedback and counteroffer.   I think we have almost an agreement. I am pleased about your concession concerning the catering. In return, I am willing to accept Boomerang as our sponsor. Although Art Inc. would have been a good choice for us, with Boomerang, like you already mentioned, we have at least a certain planning certainty for future events. That is also not too bad.   Regarding the music act, I am still not happy with your proposal. I can see your concerns about FreeLife. You should not forget that, over the last years, there was an increasing dissatisfaction of the guests with the music acts at our events. So I am sure, a famous pop band would be ideal to attract the kind of dynamic guests we are looking for, which could then in turn be interested in our organization. Moreover, ISA is famous for an open-minded and cosmopolitan appearance. However a local Russian band would not satisfy the expectations of all our guests from all around the world.   As a sign of approach you can still hold the opening speech. I am still good with that.   What do you think about my ideas? For me, this would be a good tradeoff between your and my preferences.   I am waiting for your response and I am sure we come to a good solution in the end.   Kind regards,   Alex  
Hey Alex, I am really glad to hear from you. I think we are almost done here, we only have to find a solution to the last open two points the speech and the music act. Besides I want you to know that I really appreciate your concession concerning the sponsor, thank you for that. After the terrible experience made by ISA in 2004, we both know this event must be a success and we are only a small step away from this to happen. As I start to trust you, I want to tell you that I really like to get a full-time job at ISA after this event. Because of all this we should mark our goal to set up the best possible conference. To forget about the disaster in Russia 2004, I think we should focus for the Russian culture at least at the music. I already talked to some bussines man here in Russia and they signalized me that they really would appreciate that kind of music. Since we are trying to establish a new office in Russia, I think this is a vital part and we should focus on our Russian guest preliminary. Besides the local opinion is outstanding about this band, so they should be able to make some fine music for all of us. To the point of the speech, I know you also would be very interested of guiding as a host through the event. That's why I want you to hold the speech. With this kind of attraction you can make the perfect advertisement for yourself . For myself I would like to take a place in the audience, until the announcement of the awards. So I can get in touch with some important guys from ISA and maybe can get some first contacts for job offers. Think about it Alex and keep in mind: we need an agreement until 4pm today. Until then, have a nice day. Best wishes   Chris
Hi Chris, I agree with you, we really should come to a result now. Since I have got some other appointments till 4 pm, this will be my last mail. Though I am still not too enthusiastic about our music act, think this is probably the best solution for the purpose of you, me and our organization and holding the opening speech is also a possibility to underline the internationality and the open-minded spirit of ISA. All in all I can say it was a pleasure to work with you and I am sure we will do a great job! Best wishes Alex
Hello,Chris. My name ist Alex,and I would like to talk with you about the ISA event.It's very important for us to talk about how we would organize this,and decide what it's best or suited,or not for this year competition.   I look forward to talk with you and eventually meet you at the ISA event.     Have a nice day!
Hi Alex, thank you for your message. Iï¿½m sorry for the late response, but my internet connection didnï¿½t work. We already have settled some issues for the conference together. But there are still some aspects that we have to discuss. What are your preferences regarding the date of conference? The date of the conference has not been fixed yet. As you already know some dates are conflicting with other events. So letï¿½s talk about it. What are your preferences? I hope you are fine and hope to hear from you soon. Greetings, Chris  
Hello,Chris I've got your last e-mail.It's not a problem.I'm glad that we can speak about these details.I will send to you my preferences and how I see the overall  organisation. For example,for catering I think the best ideea is if we have an international buffet,so everybody can enjoy the food and eat something good.We both know that at this event will be different kind of people from different culture,so it's important to mantain a level of satisfaction. I know that the date of conference will be in the same time with another events,so for example for week three in december,it would be ok.Let's say,during the week,Thursday on the 17th December.I think that week number 4 it's not a good option for all of us,because of the Christmas holiday. Another important aspect,it would be the music.I would imagine a great atmophere,and I would include here a Dj.I would say Dj Happy. About the presentation tasks,if you don't have any problemes,I think I can manage the first part of the event,meaning that I can hold a speech at the beginning of the event,and for example you would hold the awards by the end and thank all the sponsors and people that were there. The last concern,is the sponsor selection.As far as I know,Art Inc. is the best option for us,because they were our last sponsor and I think it would be better to keep them also this year.   I look forward for your next replay.Please tell me how you think about it and we would see how we can work it out! Have a good day!
Hi Alex, your offer sounds interesting. Letï¿½s talk about it. We should identify options which meet the needs of both of us. As you know, the winners will be rewarded by Dr. Illenschitz with a job offer at ISA. Therefore it is important to have good performance to win this project. We have to work together to get the best result and to maximize the chance to win. Iï¿½m totally optimistic, that our collaboration will be good. You also know, that this event is very important , because the organisation ISA failed to establish an office in Moscow in 2004. We have to ensure succes with our concept. Therefore the main reason for this yearï¿½s celebration being in Russia is for future aspects. We want to use this event to establish contacts to many local business people and officials as possible. WE have to make the Russian guests and new members feel appreciated. The music act and catering would be two aspects where we can show our appreciation.  Donï¿½t you think it would be better to offer Local Russian cuisine and maybe a local band? This would show our big interest in this country. How does your concept support our goal? Hope to hear from you soon. Greetings, Chris
Hello again,Chris. I saw your e-mail.I 'm glad that you have respond to my e-mail and said to me how you think about my offer.You've said very well that we need to show our appreciation in the catering and music for our russian clients. I was thinking to animate more the event and to keep everybody interested,not only the russian clients.I also think that a Dj,for example Dj Happy would do an amazing job and put some new music.We can ask him to put some russian song on a new beat and everybody could be having a good time.He will attract more people because he is quite famous. My personal oppinion about the music and catering for example,is not to separate the different cultures,because the students that are participanting as competitors are our most important persons.So,the international mixture as food would be a good thing.Then we can talk and put many types of food,including some small thing from Russia, but not just russian traditional food. I think if we attract students,then we attract business(clients).If we can obtain the Dj and the catering ,we would put our students on the first spot.     Please write to me for any question do you have and we could figure it out! Have a good night!    
"  Hi Alex,   thanks for your feedback. In your answer I donï¿½t really see the fullfilling of our goal.   In my opinion the music act is an easy way to show ISAï¿½s interest in the Russian culture and therefore I prefer a local russian band. I donï¿½t agree with DJ Happy as a music act - he might be a famous international star ï¿½ but that is the problem. I think there could be the risk that his reputation would overshadow the reputation of the ISA. But we donï¿½t want to distract attention from the event towards the music act. We dontï¿½t want ISA to be a side act.   Regarding the catering I am sure, that a Russian cuisine would suit the purpose. In addition to that it should not be a buffet. At the event we should have a real menu and not a buffet, since we expect many important people to be there who expect a certain level of formality. Everything that is less than a three course meal would be decline from the conferences over the last few years of ISA.   To sum it up: a local russian band and and a local russian cuisine will fit best to our goal.   You want to put the student on the first spot; but I think for these goal we should do some internal events. I think the goal of this event are really our Russian guests. We want to build a new office in Russia and this is OUR CHANCE.   In addition to that I would like to talk about the presentation task. You suggested, that you would like to make the speech. YOU know that the opening ceremony is the perefect place to reach a broad audience. If you make the opening speech you will leave a lasting impression. This would have an high impact on your future perspectives. Taking a third person for doing the task does not make sense for me.   IF you would agree on a local russian band and an local russian cuisine (the best concept to fulfill our goals) I would agree on the fact, that you wil make the presentation speech. But only under these conditions.   Do you AGREE?   Think about it and let me know.   About the other things we can discuss later!       Greetings,   Chris    "
Hello,Chris. Thank you for the answer. I analysed your preferences and I see your point.I also think that is very important to keep our russian clients satisfied,because we all wish to extend in Russia.But if we just focused on the russian clients,and not of the whole mixture of cultures,we would loose the attention and aprreciation of the other people. If we think on the future,is it more important to attract and keep our future students.Because without them,the organisation and everything would not exist more, and not to forget that the present competition from the other organisation are much higher these days. Many of us and for our clients are not used to the russian food,so I will propuse to you if we can do it with 3 course meal.Not buffet or russian food,but maybe with an international 3 course meal,for a higher level of formality.So,I think this would work for both of us. Regarding the music,we can bring a russian local band,as you said. In my oppinion,we should not just focused on a single group of people and make the others feel isolated and to remember not so good things that happened that night of the evening.I know that our main goal is to keep our russian clients happy,but if you think this event is for them and make for them.   I hope this offer would satisfied the both of us Looking forward for your answer!
Hello Alex, Thank you for sharing and understanding my interests. I agree that we also should not lose the attention for our ISA people. But this conference, where we celebrate our anniversary is combined with the newly established subsidiary in Saint Petersburg. We should use this event to get in touch with Russian business partners. We want to win some companies for our partner network, so that we can offer leadership programmes for our students in this organization. To be a successful multinational organization we always should focus on new contacts.  The celebration will be visited by many business people of Russian companies that will help ISA to establish itself as a legitimate organization in Russia. As you know this is our second attempt ï¿½ therefore we have to ensure success. If we can attract new potential business partners, it will bring benefits for our students. And without our business contacts we will not attract future students. When we decide to take local Russian food, we definitely show a big attention for our business partners. We would show them, that we are interested in their culture. Food is an important part of the culture of a country. In Russia food and drinks have a high priority. We can keep our Russian clients more satisfied, when we choose to take Local Russian cuisine and for the students of our organization it is also a great opportunity to try out international food. If we choose the local Russian cuisine I would be okay for me, if we take Free Life as a music act. I would prefer the Russian local band but I would be okay with it, if we take the band Free Life. I think this would be a fair offer from my side: we choose the middle option. I know that the band Free life is famous and known in Russia and is suited to accompany the evening without being the main act. In my offer you see, that I propose Boomerang as the main sponsor.  As our main sponsor we should only take into consideration four companies. You want to take Art Inc. as our sponsor, because it was our last one. I definitely think that Boomerang should be our main sponsor. They offered us a long-term contract. This would provide financial security for upcoming ISA events. Regarding the date of the conference, I think week 3 is okay. Itï¿½s not my preferred date but for me it is important to collaborate with you so I want to make a fair offer. Iï¿½m looking forward to your response. Have a nice evening! Chris
Hello,Chris. Thanks again for the message and that you are quite into it.I'm glad that a have a workmate with whom I can freely talk about the details of this event.I'm so excited about everything and I cannot wait for that night. I will agree with your offer to take the Pop band FreeLife and to take the russian food. Just a small problem that we need to talk more about.If we choose the sponsor Boomerang,who is a direct competitor to the Art Inc,we would loose Art Inc who was suporting us for so long with a lot of money.If we choose these year Boomerang,a new sponsor,is not sure that in the next year they will sponsor us and suport us for many years,like Art Inc.So,we would risk a lot if we will achieved the subsidiary in Russia.At the beginning we will need a safe support for the image and money,and I think Art Inc. will be a safer choice because we already know them and they are wiiling to suport us again this year.   To resume,I will except the offer with the russian food,and the pop band FreeLife,If we go to the safer choice for the sponsor,such as Art Inc,because it is very important to have a safe support in Russia for the beginning and not to risk.     Have a great evening!
Hi Alex, hope you are fine. I also think that it is good to talk about the details about the event. We should have a good concept to convince Dr. Illenschitz and the ISA organisation. I still think, that Boomerang would be the better sponsor selection for this important event. And I donï¿½t agree with your statement that Art. Inc will be the safer sponsor. Like I already wrote you Boomerang is willing to sign a long-term contract. It would provide us with financial security within the next years. And with Art Inc. we donï¿½t even have a contract. We know that Art. Inc has always donated money for our events, but we donï¿½t have a contract with them regarding the future. I was thinking about your offer and I would collaborate with you in the case, that we will take the sponsor Art. Inc again- but I would only agree only under the conditions that we take the Local Russian band as a music act. I proposed you the middle option Free Life as a music act, but I donï¿½t think its fair, that we only support your needs. In case of the date of the event and in case of the sponsor selection I am supporting your needs and interest. As a thank you from your side I would be happy if you would agree on my catering and on my music act proposal. We should find options that support both partyï¿½s needs. In this offer I am supporting your sponsor selection and the date of conference.   Hope to hear from you soon! Have a nice day!  
Hello again,Chris. I've read your e-mail.I'm so happy that the date of the event is coming.Of course your needs are also important. To make it short,I will except your offer with the local russian band,the local russian cuisine,and our sponsor to be in this case Art Inc. I hope this offer would be ok. It would be nice to have a final answer from you,till 10:00 in the morning,because I'm going to leave tomorrow on a business trip and also to give in the afternoon an answer to the other members of the organisation.   Thanks again that you are collaborating with me.   Have a good night and see you soon!
Dear Chris, I am very looking forward to a successful negotiation and a great conference. What I would talk about first of all are the items  Catering  and  Sponsor Selection I think the International Buffet would meet the character of an international organization's meeting the most. Concerning the sponsor selection, I think Art Inc. has made the best offer. What do you think? Also I want to ask you how import it is to you to do the Presentation Tasks. Because the speech would be a great chance for me. Yours sincerely Alex
Hello Alex, I am also looking forward to achieve a successful solution together.  But with your current offer I cannot fully agree. For the Catering I would prefer to have a local Russian cuisine to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. Also I think we should prefer a real manu rather than a buffet because many important people will attend and they will expect a certain level of formality. Also the last few years we always had a menu and a buffet would be therefore a decline. Catering: local Russian cuisine   You are right that Art Inc. made the best offer for the current event. But Boomerang offered us a long-term sponsoring contract and therefore would therefore ensure also future events. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang   For me the speech would also be a great opportunity to show my abilities and motivations. But I would be willing to share the Presentation Tasks: Shared activities . Best regards, Chris
Hello Chris, I really think most of our guests won't like the russian food. I have to insist on a more international character here, but I see why you prefer Boomerang as a sponsor. I propose a compromise here: we can take  Sponsor Selection: Boomerang, but then Catering: International buffet.  I don't like your idea of sharing the tasks. I need to be focused on one task. But we could hire a third person if you want: Presentation Tasks: Third person  What are your preferences for the other 2 items? And what do you think is most important? Best regards Alex  
Hello Alex, I am glad to hear that you also see Boomerang as the better opporunity here. I am willing to accept your compromise with the further condition that we should serve the Catering: International three course meal due to the reasons I stated in the former message. A buffet would be a decline of our previous events and I believe that our important guests don't want to queue half an hour to get their meal.  If you are willing to accept the three course meal I am willing to commit that the speech will be hold by you and the awards by me: Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris . Because I believe hiring a third party doesn't yield anything for both of us. What do you think?  I think determining the date of the conference is most important. The third week would be perfect as it is not too close to Christmas and we are not colliding with the International Conference on Economics and Business Management in Moscow. If we are agreeing on taking an international catering I would propose to have thereofore a local Russian band for the entertainment. This would show the ISA's interest in the Russion culture what is an important basis to start good relationship with our new members. So Music Act: Local Russian band  and Date of Conference: Week 3  would be my recommendations here.  Best regards, Chris  
Dear Chris, thank you for offering me that I can do the speech in exchange forCatering: International three course meal. But the buffet is way more important to me than the speech. I think having a buffet during which you would be free to move around and talk while eating would be much more relaxed. So I would prefer  Catering: International buffet  and let you do the speech instead. If that would be a too big loss for you, I can accept it and also I can live with Date of Conference: Week 3  if we can agree on Music Act: DJ Happy, which would be my favourite for the Music Act. A famous international act would be exactly the right thing to attract the kind of dynamic guests the ISA is looking for. Yours sincerely, Alex
Hey Alex, thank you for your counteroffer. I see your points for the buffet but still believe that a formal three course meal meets much better the formality of this kind of an event. If wee can agree on Catering: International three course meal I will accept DJ Happy as Music Act: DJ Happy  although I think a local band or at least the band FreeLive would fit much better here because the attention should not be not focused entirely on the entertainment programme. What do you think? Do find here an agreement?  Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, Yes I think we found an agreement here. Thanks for your understanding. It was a pleasure to negotiate with you and I think we found a solution here we both can be happy with. Kind regards Alex
Dear Chris,  I hope we could do a good job together since I am very motivated and confident about this assignment. Without further ado, I am going to let you know my thoughts about the Saint Petersburg's Conference. Firstly, I strongly believe that we have to keep trusting our long relationship with Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.They have supported us for a long time and they made the best payment offer, therefore I think they are the best option for ISA.  Secondly, a Catering: International buffet with food from different countries should be offered, considering that there will be people from everywhere and that in this way they would be free to move and talk with each others.  In the third place, I think is better for some of ISA's higher ranked members to perform the Conference in the third week of DecemberDate of Conference: Week 3. Moreover, we should hire Music Act: DJ Happy, who could play music from many different styles to make the guests satisfied. Finally, I could let you do the award ceremony and I would do the opening speech.  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   Best regards,    Alex
Dear Alex,  I am also looking forward to working with you together to achieve a good preparation for the Conference. Thank you for letting me know your thoughts about the upcoming Conference in Saint Petersburg. According to your suggestion about the Date of Conference: Week 3 . I came up with the same date that we should settle the conference in Week 3 because as you have already mentioned - it is the best opportunity for higher ranked members of ISA. So I think we should fix it ok? Secondly, you have suggested to take Art Inc as our sponsor. You are right that they have been supporting us for a long time but I have a second company in mind called Boomerang ( Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  ). In my opinion we should choose Boomerang because they are willing to build a long-term relationship. Thirdly, you have mentioned that I have the possibility to do the award ceremony of the presentation tasks. I am ok with this but we can also share the activities if you like to? Presentation Tasks: Shared activities   Furthermore, I would like to let you know my thoughts about the Catering. I think we should provide for Catering: local Russian cuisine  instead of an International buffet because it would be something different to other conferences and I think it is of interest for the participants because it is something new. The last part I would like to mention is the Music Act: FreeLife  . You have suggested to hire Dj Happy but unfortunately I have to disagree with your suggestion because I think that the pop band FreeLife is a better option for such an event because they can be the musical accompaniment. So I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I am glad we both agree in the date of conference. I am afraid I do not agree with your idea of changing the sponsor because I think is a risky movement. Yes, it is true that they offer a long-term contract, but as you know so well, contracts are made to be broken, and we do not have any previous relationship, so we do not if our organizationï¿½s culture will fit with them. Consequently, I believe our best option is to keep trusting our longtime partner Art Inc, a company we know and rely on. Besides, they are willing to pay more than Boomerang.  Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.   I am not so certain about sharing activities, as it would be more complicated to perform and we could make more mistakes, so I think it would be harmful for both of us. Therefore, I would keep the other option.  Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   I see your point in the Catering topic, but the International buffet would include local Russian cuisine, so it would be more considerate to the people who do not like the Russian cuisine, and would be recommendable due to the guests could walk and interact with the others.  Catering: International buffet   Finally, I do not understand you on your argument. Dj Happy will be also the musical accompaniment. Moreover, he is a famous performer among young students and I am sure that his presence will attract more guests. Besides, if we trust Dj Happy we would have the advantage that he could play any type of music, not only Pop.  Music Act: DJ Happy   Yours sincelerly,   Alex
Dear Alex, I see your argument for the sponsor Art Inc. but I cannot even agree with it. You are right that they are paying more than Boomerang, but it is just a one-time payment because we do not have a contract with them and it might be the last payment they have made. You are right that contracts are broken sometimes but we can protect ourselves with a good contract formulation. Furthermore, relationships can also be quit, altough they are a long term-relationship. So in my opinion a written contract is much more valuable than just relying on Art Inc. that they are going to sponsor us in the future. Sponsor Selection: Boomerang According to the catering I get your point. But as there will be many people invited to the conference I think it will get chaotic if everybody is moving around. With a planned meal of local Russian cuisin we could have a better overview of our conference and I think that this is fine for all participants. Catering: local Russian cuisine   With the next point of having Dj Happy as the music act I see your thoughts behind it but what I wanted to say with musical accompaniment is that the Popband FreeLife would be more like a background music. Moreover, you have mentioned that Dj Happy might attract more people - you might be right with this point but this could also lead to the situation that some people are just participating in the conference because of Dj Happy and this would miss the aim of the conference. You have also said that Dj Happy is famous among young students and I am not sure if there are that many students on the conference as it is more likely for companies. Music Act: FreeLife   For the presentation tasks, this is a good point you have made and your suggestion would be fine for me. Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris   I would be glad to hear you soon. Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris,  I understand what you say about the sponsor but I am not sure about it. Maybe we could find a mid-point between our offers and let ï¿½Corporate Ltd.ï¿½ do the sponsorship. What do you think? About the catering and the music, I would agree to hire FreeLife if you agree to have an international buffet. Let me know what you think. Alex    
Dear Alex, concerning to your suggestion about hiring Corporate Ltd for the sponsorship, I am unfortunately against hiring this company because we either have not had a long relationship with them nor they are willing to sign a long-term contract for future payments. I still think that we should go for Boomerang as they will give as guarantees for future events. I appreciate that you would be fine with FreeLife but I am afraid to tell you that I am not convenient with an international buffet. As you know we have already tried to establish an office in Moscow in 2004 which has failed due to preparation problems. Therefore, I think it is really necessary to reach especially Russian people to get in contact with Russian companies for building relationships with them. This is the reasion why it is so important for me to go for Local Russian cuisine. Best regards, Chris
Dear Chris, I am agree with you about the sponsorhip, maybe Corporate Ltd do not suit us. Perhaps Boomerang is better for the both of us. I did not say that I am fine with Free Life, I meant that you could manage the music thing and I would deal with the catering. As you mentioned, we failed in 2004 due to preparation problems, so offer local cuisine would be more complicated for us and we should not fail again. Consequently, we should go for a more universal International buffet, a formula we have been using in our more successful ceremonies all over the world. Time is running out and we have to be seen as a strong and encouraging team, so I am confidence we will understand us. Kind regards,   Alex
Hi Alex, I appreciate that we could agree on the sponsorship to take Boomerang.  Yes I would be happy to manage the music art and offer FreeLife as our band for the conference and I see the point with the catering. You might be right that this is too risky. As you have said that there is little time left, it would be fine for me if we could agree on an International three course meal because we have already done this kind of catering in our past conferences so we have enough experience to manage such a meal. Furthermore, we provide different meals for people from different countries as you have mentioned in an earlier message. I hope you could agree on my suggestion that we can start our preparation for the conference and make it a successful celebration of our 40th anniversary. Best regards, Chris
Hi Chris,  I am glad that at the end we could reach an agreement. I am looking forward to working with you as soon as posible to prepare the most successful ISA Conference ever.  Kind regards,  Alex
Hello Chris, How are you? First of all I want to thank you for our already settled issues for the conference. I think if we go on like this we have a real chance to win the competition. I am really looking forward to organize the conference in real together with you. I believe our conference would be a relaxing and lovely evening for our guests, no matter if they are high ISA members, local business people or us, the students. Therefore, I have some suggestions we still have to talk about. One open issue is the Music Act: In my opinion it would be great to have DJ Happy ( Music Act: DJ Happy ). As the music acts form the last years have not been that good. Therefore, I suggest him, as he is both a professional and a really famous musician, he knows what our evening at the conference needs. What do you think? Another point is the catering, I suggest a buffet. The advantage is that everybody is able to find something they like. If we arrange it as an international buffet every guest has also the possibility to discover new meals ( Catering: International buffet  ). Also the exact date of the conference is not yet fixed. The CEO of ISA gave us the timeframe of five weeks in December. In order to avoid a collision with another conference that takes place, I propose the third week in December ( Date of Conference: Week 3  ). Another great act of the evening is the announcement of the year's award winners, which are several ISA members that gave made a big impact for the ISA organization in the past and the other act is the opening speech. For the announcement of the awards I propose you and I would really looking forward to do the opening speech ( Presentation Tasks: Speech by Alex and awards by Chris  ). Last thing we have to organize is the sponsor selection. As the Art Inc. had the best offer as a short term payment directly for the event I would engage them as our sponsor ( Sponsor Selection: Art Inc.  ). What is your opinion? I look forward to hear from you soon. Best regards, Alex
"Dear Alex, thanks for your information and your really nice e-mail. Im also looking forward to plan a good event. And I think if we do good we will win the competition. Never the less, I can't agree on your opening offer due to some reasons, but I'm sure we can handle the issues and meet at the best possible solution for both. First the music act. As I know DJ Happy is a famous international music star and i think that it might be really interesting for the younger generation, my concern is first, that DJ Happy will overshadow the reputation of the ISA and distract attention from the event towards the music act. Personally my vision for the event is that we should show interest in the russian culture and therefore we should have a local russian band as the music act. Please let it go through your mind and send me your answer ( Music Act: Local Russian band  ). Second the catering, as mentioned I think that local russian cuisine would suit the purpose to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. My opinion is, that since we are expecting many important people to be there who expect a certain level of formality. Therefore I recommend a local russian cuisine. ( Catering: local Russian cuisine ).  I agree on your third week for the date conference. So let us fix this ;-) ( Date of Conference: Week 3 ). Well point four is going to be the more difficult one I think. We both know that the speech is highly more prestigious and more important than the awards announcement. (CV issues etc...) And since there is a high coordination effort of doing half-half my opinion is that this is a winner takes it all issue and there should be discussed later on. Of course I don't know how important the speech is for you and therefore in this counteroffer I will change the speech-awards roles and wait for your answer. ( Presentation Tasks: Speech by Chris and awards by Alex  ). Last thing sponsor selection Art Inc. made the best offer and to be honest, they are my second best option. But with a highly difference. to the frist one. This is due to the fact, that boomerang made also a very good offer, of course not that much money, but they said that they would be willing to sign a long-term contract. This would ensure some financial security and in the long run im totally sure, that this long term contract with boomerang would be a really good deal for the ISA and a highly prestigious deal, if we can get them to be our sponsors. By the way. To build some trust to each other aswell as doing more transperent negotiation I can tell you that the sponsor issue has the most importance for me.And i Really would be happy if we take boomerang. ( Sponsor Selection: Boomerang  ). Sincerely Chris"
Dear Chris Sorry for the late answer I had a problem with the negoisst system and the support tried to fix it. Thank you a lot for your really honest and transparent email, I am really glad about our first agreement on the date of the conference. I think our team works well and the competition will be peanuts. I thought about your arguments and can truly follow your argumentation. But there are some points our opinions differ. Let me comment on my choices for the opening offer. In the following I want to tell you more about my ideas for the conferenceJ and how we can include your proposals. First of all I want to say that you are absolutely right about showing the Russian culture, this should be an integral part of the conference. From my point of view it would be better if we find a good mix between Russian culture and other nationalities. I think international is also important because ISA is an international organization, but I see your point that Russian dance and catering should be a part of the evening. Therefore my proposal about the Music act is: We could ask DJ Happy to also play Russian music, I think this would exceed everybodyï¿½s expectations and would be a great success. He could play a mix of international charts, Russian charts and Russian folksongs. This mix would attract students, young and dynamic Russian business people, as well as international business people or old-established business people. To my other point: You are completely right, this DJ is especially known by younger people. But as I think we are a Student Association it would be great to have something that attracts younger people like us. Thereby we can address the students on their wavelength and gain their interest for the ISA. I doubt that this overshadows the anniversary. Above I believe it will be a magnet that attracts a lot of dynamic guests the ISA is looking for.       To the catering: I really prefer a buffet as it is an international event and it would be great to have a wide range of international food. I agree with you that it would be great to have local Russian food but I am afraid that many people are not familiar with Russian cuisine. Therefore, I think it would be better to have a buffet, where everybodyï¿½s taste is satisfied. Summing up, we could have an international buffet including local Russian food and specialties.   To the other topic, the presentation tasks: I also think this is a difficult point to discuss :). Shared activities need a high coordination effort and they may lead to confusion and disturb the speech, therefore I agree to separate the tasks. To be honest, I also really like to do the opening speech because I really waited for a long time to have such great opportunity. But let us discuss that later.   Last thing is our sponsor for the event. Concerning the sponsors I agree with you that Boomerang and Art Inc have great offers. Corporate Ltd and the Documenta also made competitive offers but the other ones are better. From my point of view long-term contracts are superfluous to find a sponsor for ISA, as we have already four high offers for a single event. Following this logic I come to the conclusion that it is unnecessary to have a long-term contract, as we always got and will get good offers in the future. I really look forward to know about your feedback and your opinions. Sincerely, Alex  
"Hi Alex! No problem with the late answer, I received also the notification that our discussion is swapped to another channel. As you might know Im helping organise internships for other students and have a profound knowledge on business contacts and interests. Therefor I can highly recommend sponsor boomerang. The small amount of money that art.int pays more won't balance the financial security ISA would receive by the long-term contract. Please let it go through your mind again. As an counteroffer and since we now know more or less the points of each other im going to make you this counter offer, which i highly recommend to you. If you agree on boomerang, I will agree on DJ Happy, playing Russian music of course ;-).  Even in my opinion DJ Happy isn't the best idea. Ok ï¿½ think splitting the issues in several parts would make more sense, im waiting for an answer for this issue and letting the presenttion tasks and catering question opend for now, i just want to know what you think on this idea.  "
Hi Chris Thank you for your offer. I can follow your argumentation truly. To be honest the sponsoring is my most important issue. But I recognized this is essential for you, too. Due to that dilemma you offered me DJ Happy, but I am afraid to say that this is not an even offer. Therefore, I ask you to accept besides DJ Happy my proposal for the catering. I really recommend an international buffet. Given that this event is not just the celebration of the Russian subsidiary it is also the 40th anniversary of the ISA and therefore I believe an international buffet is adequate. Of course Russian food and their specialties will be offered as an essential part of the buffet. From my point of view a mix of the Russian specialties and other specialties from all over the world would suit this evening. For example we could offer specialties from Germany (as the Association was founded in Constance), Spanish tapas, burgers to represent America, Italian specialties ï¿½(like every subsidiary gets his own part of the buffet). From my point of view this mix will enrich the event and absolutely everybodyï¿½s taste will be satisfied. For the moment I leave the presentation task open, we should talk about that later. I really look forward to hear your opinion. Best regards, Alex
Hey Alex. Thank you for your anwer. Unfortunately I can't agree on your offer since, buffet really is for me not an option. In any case i need a real menu because i expect many important people on the conference who expect an certin level of formality. But if this is not an offer for you im willing to another one again.If you agree on a local russian band i agree on Art Inc. It is the same offer just in different roles, and I'm willing to let you choose, whether you want ArtInc&LocalBand or Boomerang&DJHappy. In Addition i realy get your point that international food is a good idea , i still think russian would be a better idea, but for me buffet is not an option and there for im willing to do an international three course meal if you let me the speech.   Im looking forward hearing from you Regards Chris          
Hey Chris Thank you for your fast answer. But now I am confused. I tried to go along your argumentation and preferences. I thought Boomerang is really important for you, because you said it is better to have a long-term contract than a higher single payment form Art Inc. Therefore I cannot follow your argumentation you are now willing to swap the sponsors. To get the best for the ISA and in order to stay on the offer you made me before, my opinion is to stay at Boomerang and as you agreed on DJ Happy playing also Russian music. To the catering: As you said you are the same opinion about the international food, I want to stay at the international buffet. I believe that only local Russian specialties will not work in such a multi-cultural event. In addition in order to meet new people, make new acquaintances and do some networking with the important people an atmosphere which allows this is very important. I see this atmosphere in a buffet where everybody can sit where he likes and talk to who he likes. As you know, because of your knowledge on business contacts and interests it is important to have an open and friendly atmosphere where everybody feels free to get in touch with each other. Therefore, a buffet is better than a formal three course meal. Furthermore, it is possible to plan this international buffet as an elegant buffet to satisfy the needs of important guests. I can see that you are not happy with the solution we found so far. Although I would really like to do the speech (CV, etc.), I would offer to let you do the speech. I look forward to hear from you. Best regards, Alex
Hey Alex!   Thank you for you fast answer, I'm glad that we finally agreed on the DJ/Happy+Boomerang Solution. Well again to the Catering / Speech Issue. In my opinion exlusivity rises and falls with the catering. I think that anything less than a three course meal would be a decline frrom the conferenes over the last few years, which wereN't even some special events such as the upcoming 40th anniversary and thus would harm the prestige of the ISA.  Buffet is in my opinion more for a local ISA event. Since we already agreed to Dj Happy I'm worriing that there won't be enough appreciation for the russian guests and therefor it would be a good idea to have a local russian cuisine. Im willing to let you the speech over if you might agree to an local russian cousin to show appreciation to our new Russian members and guests. Best regards Chris        
Hey Chris Thank you for your answer. But my confusion is not eliminated yet. The compromise about my favorite sponsor was a great concession. Based on your argumentation to take Boomerang I let me persuade. But as I pointed out the Sponsor is also really important to me, therefore DJ Happy compromise is not at an appropriate rate. Here I conceded to you. To get a fair compromise I asked you to agree on the international buffet. Furthermore as you said that you think international food will suit. Again I want to emphasize that from my point of view a formal dinner like a three course meal will not be that good for our event. Like you said we offered last yearï¿½s three course meals and I think a reason like the 40th anniversary of the ISA is a great opportunity to fall away from old habits. Given that we are a Student Organization consisting of students and students are a very open to changes, I believe the international buffet will be perfect. I want to point out that it is easier to get in touch with each other if we have an open atmosphere, as you know from your internships and your business contacts. Above I concluded from your previous mails that getting in touch with each other is one of your aims for the event. In my opinion it will not harm the reputation of ISA because it is possible to design the buffet as a gallant dinner. Additionally, I am really confused about the presentation task. Based on your argumentation I understood you are really interested in doing the speech. Therefore, I wanted to make a concession about the speech. For this reason I resigned to do the speech, together with the Boomerang I wanted to get it balanced. Summing up I want to point out that I agreed on Boomerang and I really look forward to convince you to take the international buffet. To find a consensus I suggest that you do the speech, despite I also like to do the speech. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hear from you. Best regards, Alex
Alright im Fine with this solution. I think it's ok to have an International Buffet, where we also will offer some russian food aswell as DJ Happy. Im happy with Boomerang, since you might see the long term contract will open new possibilites for ISA, and of course im glad to hold the speech. thanks for the interesting negotiation.  And See you at the Conference :-) Best regards, Chris
